Este nuevo √≠ndice se ha formulado como alternativa al BMWP-Col y consiste en la determinaci√≥n de un gradiente ambiental a partir de un An√°lisis de Correspondencia Can√≥nica de correlaciones entre abundancias y registros fisicoqu√≠micos. Los puntajes de las estaciones -obtenidos en las correlaciones- son estandarizados y usados en un modelo de Promedios Ponderados (WA); en el modelo se ponderan tambi√©n las abundancias para estimar los valores √≥ptimos y de tolerancia de cada tax√≥n. Con ellos y la abundancia se calcula los valores del √çndice de Calidad Ecol√≥gica con base en macroinvertebrados acu√°ticos para la cuenca del rio Negro (ICE RN-MAE ). Se utilizan los valores del √≠ndice junto con las concentraciones de f√≥sforo total (FT) en un an√°lisis de agrupamiento, para as√≠ clasificar los sitios de estudio. De ah√≠ se obtienen finalmente los valores medios, m√°ximos, m√≠nimos y de desviaci√≥n est√°ndar del ICE RN-MAE y FT. Con ellos se definen los umbrales que corresponden a diferentes categor√≠as de calidad ecol√≥gica (buena, regular y cr√≠tica).","2014","2021-08-11 16:13:50","2021-08-11 16:13:50",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Espa√±ol",NA,"macroinvertebrados; macroinvertebrates; BMWP- Col; BMWP-Col; Ecological status index; environmental gradient; gradiente ambiental; √çndice de calidad ecol√≥gica; quebradas tropicales.; tropical stream.",NA,NA,"readlyc_sphaeriidae"

We investigated whether changes in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and ecological functioning were associated with mussel presence. We compared sites with and without mussels, with similar habitat conditions, in an eastern Amazonian river, using field measurements of macroinvertebrate structure, hydrological variables and sediment organic matter, and laboratory experiments of mussel clearance rate and biodeposition. Sites with mussels were associated with higher macroinvertebrate abundance and number of taxa, especially for trichopterans Marilia (shredder), Oecetis (predator) and Antarctoecia (collector). Decreased chlorophyll-a in the water column and increased sediment organic matter were positively associated with mussel presence. Laboratory experiments corroborated these patterns, which were stronger with higher mussel density. Mussel filtration and biodeposition may be associated with habitat quality for other invertebrates by lowering phytoplankton density in the water column and increasing inputs of sediment organic matter. This suggests a potential role of freshwater mussels in ecosystem function associated with high taxonomic and functional diversity in the macroinvertebrate assemblages of an eastern Amazon river, enhancing the already high mussel conservation priority.","","2021-08-11 16:16:45","2021-08-11 16:16:45","","",NA,"","","","English","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","Bivalve; Clearance rates; Biodeposition; Functional groups; Keystone species",NA,"","wos_final"

Heinrich stadials are examples of abrupt climate transitions that involved shifts in regional temperatures and moisture availability. Thus, they serve as natural experiments to evaluate the contrasting responses of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We used ostracodes and pollen preserved in a 75.9-m-long sediment core (PI-6, similar to 85 ka) recovered from Lake Peten Itza, Guatemala, to assess the magnitude and velocity of community responses. Ostracodes are sensitive to changes in water temperature and conductivity. Vegetation responds to shifts in temperature and the ratio of evaporation to precipitation. Ostracodes display larger and more rapid community changes than does vegetation. Heinrich Stadial 5-1 (HS5-1) was cold and dry and is associated with lower ostracode and vegetation species richness and diversity. In contrast, the slightly warmer and dry conditions during HS6 and HS5a are reflected in higher ostracode species richness and diversity. Our paleoecological study revealed the greatest ecological turnover for ostracodes occurred from 62.5 to 51.0 ka; for pollen, it was at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition.

In the Amazon, which is undergoing widespread human-mediated alterations, information on mussel ecology is lacking. We investigated whether declines in mussel density, due to exploitation, are associated with lower macroinvertebrate assemblage taxon richness and modified habitat functioning in an Amazonian river. Between 2015 and 2017, macroinvertebrate metrics of abundance and number of families, and related habitat variables, were compared between exploited and unexploited mussel beds in the Caete river, northeastern Para state, Brazil. Except for Chironomidae abundance, which increased, other macroinvertebrate metrics decreased in exploited mussel beds, especially abundances of shredders and predators. Medium and high mussel densities appear to support abundant and diverse macroinvertebrate assemblages. Macroinvertebrate decreases were mainly correlated with lower organic matter in the sediment and higher dissolved solids in the water column, due to losses in mussel biodeposition and filtration functions. Amazonian freshwater mussel density is a useful indicator of abundant and diverse macroinvertebrate assemblages, and mussel beds may help prioritize locations for habitat conservation in Amazonian rivers, and indirectly for fishes that are essential for mussel dispersion. Aquatic management efforts should explicitly include mussel beds and their diverse associated macroinvertebrate assemblages.","2021-03","2021-08-11 16:16:46","2021-08-11 16:16:46","","",122,"","","","English","Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article","Management; Biodiversity; Functional groups; Bivalve declines; Ecological functions; Exploitation",NA,"","wos_final"

The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological responses of L. fortunei after feeding on Microcystis aeruginosa grown at 26 degrees C (control) and 29 degrees C during 10 days. At the beginning, we measured biomass, fatty acids (FAs) composition on Cyanobacteria grown at both temperatures at different time intervals. Afterwards, mussels were fed with the thawed M. aeruginosa cells and their FA profile was measured after 15 days of feeding. M. aeruginosa exposed to 29 degrees C had the highest content of the FAs 18:2 omega 6 and cis-18:1 omega 9. The FA profile of the consumer L. fortunei fed with M. aeruginosa cultures grown at 29 degrees C was also significantly different to those fed with cultures grown at 26 degrees C, with a significant increased Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) and Arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4 omega 6) concentrations. L. fortunei was already known to be physiologically adapted to live at 29 degrees C, but our results also shown a high biosynthesis of EPA and ARA (increase of 70 and 40% respectively, compared with 26 degrees C) and avoided the lipid peroxidation of both FAs. This increased EPA and ARA biosynthesis may be an important source of omega 3 and omega 6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) for higher trophic levels, such as the pelagic fishes or birds that mainly prey on these mussels. The transfer of the cyanobacterial response at higher temperature to higher trophic levels will influence the overall functioning of freshwater bodies.","2021-02","2021-08-11 16:16:46","2021-08-11 16:16:46","","",240,"","","","English","Place: STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC Type: Article","Fatty acids; Microcystis aeruginosa; Limnoperna fortunei; Adaptation; Temperature increase",NA,"","wos_final"

Also, the digestive gland morphometry through quantitative histological indexes was registered at the tissular level. Finally, filtering activity and burial behavior at the individual level were measured. At the highest CLT concentration, the most significant changes were observed in enzymatic activity (except for butyrylcholinesterase), lipid peroxidation and in digestive gland morphometry. It was also registered increases of the filtering activity and the latency time to burial. Most of the biomarkers assessed showed significant responses under CLT exposure. Therefore, taking into account that C. largillierti was affected by CLT, it can be expected that other species could be in a potential risk if this fungicide is present in freshwater systems.","2021-01-15","2021-08-11 16:16:46","2021-08-11 16:16:46","","",208,"","","","English","Place: 525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA Publisher: ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE Type: Article","Invasive bivalve; Behavioral responses; Digestive glandmorphometry; Fungicides; Oxidative stress responses",NA,"","wos_final"

The main advances relative to the seeding technique for keshi pearl production and composite technique for half-pearl (mabe) production are detailed and placed under perspective with China, as today's greatest producer of freshwater pearls. After ten years, several cohorts of keshi and mabe pearls have been produced, representing the first of their kind in Latin America. Although the yield and quality of these pearls has gradually been improved, some aspects of the keshi technique (preparation and seeding of the donor's mantle into the host's mantle) still require further optimisation. To promote social development, one of the goals of the project included the involvement of local communities in the manufacture and selling of handcrafts made from the shell. The other goal was to share the main outcomes derived from the keshi and mabe techniques with academics, producers, and government authorities through a series of training workshops aimed to create awareness in the local communities for the potential of freshwater pearl culture in Tabasco as an aquaculture-based, environmentally friendly and viable model for socioeconomic development.","2021-06","2021-08-11 16:16:46","2021-08-11 16:16:46","1379-1396","3",13,"","","","English","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","freshwater mussels; Mexico; aquaculture; half-pearls; keshi pearls",NA,"","wos_final"

The main environmental differences between the reservoir and the rivers are that the former has finer sediment grain size, higher temperatures, and lower oxygen concentration during summer months. This study aimed to evaluate whether one of these factors could be limiting the distribution of C. largillierti. We assessed the metabolic response and burial behavior (under different grain sizes) of C. largillierti over 8 weeks at 30 degrees C against a control condition at 20 degrees C. We also analyzed the oxygen consumption (vO(2)) as a function of environmental oxygen concentration (pO(2)) at 25 degrees C, estimating its metabolic regulation capacity (R). This showed the existence of an environmental oxygen concentration threshold (P-t) that could be an indicative of physiological limiting concentrations that compromise species survival and settlement. After 8 weeks at 30 degrees C, the metabolic rate of individuals of C. largillierti increased and their burial behavior was slightly compromised but mostly for coarser sediments. Concerning environmental oxygen availability, C. largillierti is an oxyconformer with a low R (39.9%), a clear pattern of negative regulation, and a low P-t (48.4% air saturation). The lack of any regulation capacity of C. largillierti under environmental oxygen limitations and the extremely low pO(2) at the bottom of the reservoir during summer months may explain its failure to colonize and survive there.","2020-12","2021-08-11 16:16:46","2021-08-11 16:16:46","","4",139,"","","","English","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","freshwater bivalve; invasive species; burial behavior; hypoxia; oxyconformer",NA,"","wos_final"

We present field data on the distributions of the nominal Castalia ambigua and C. inflata in the upper Paraguay River basin in Brazil based on original occurrence data at 23 sample sites and on historical records. The upper basin has distinct highland and lowland regions, the latter including the Pantanal wetland, where ‚ÄúC. ambigua‚Äù occurs in the highlands and ‚ÄúC. inflata‚Äù occurs in both regions. At Baixo Stream in the highlands, we observed individuals with shell morphologies of either C. ambigua or C. inflata, and also individuals with intermediate shell morphology. DNA sequence variation in the upland Baixo Stream and two representative lowland populations were screened. Two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes were sequenced to test hypotheses regarding the number of species-level phylogenetic lineages present. Reported individual DNA sequences from Amazon-basin C. ambigua and other Castalia and outgroup species were included in the analysis as outgroups. Individuals from the Paraguay River basin exhibited 17 haplotypes at the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene and nine at mitochondrial 16S rRNA. Analysis of haplotype networks and phylogenetic trees of combined COI + 16S rRNA sequences among individuals with the respective shell morphologies supported the hypothesis that C. ambigua and C. inflata from the Paraguay River basin belong to the same species and one phylogenetic lineage. No variation was observed at the nuclear 18S rRNA internal transcribed spacer, 28S rRNA, or H3NR histone genes among individuals used in this study. Across all markers, less variation was observed among Paraguay basin populations than between Paraguay and Amazon basin populations. Our results collectively suggest that: (1) ‚ÄúC. ambigua‚Äù, ‚ÄúC. inflata‚Äù, and morphologically intermediate individuals within the upper Paraguay drainage represent one phylogenetic lineage, (2) a phylogeographic divide exists between Castalia populations occurring in the Paraguay and Amazon River basins, and (3) the evolutionary and taxonomic uncertainties that we have identified among Castalia species should be thoroughly assessed across their distribution using both morphological and molecular characters.","2020-12","2021-08-11 16:16:46","2021-08-11 16:16:46","","12",12,"","","","English","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","Brazil; freshwater mussels; distribution; Paraguay river basin; phylogeography",NA,"","wos_final"

The role of dark false mussel for water quality improvement in a multi-impacted urban coastal lagoon","WATER RESEARCH","","0043-1354","10.1016/j.watres.2020.116108",NA,"The dark false mussel Mytilopsis leucophaeata occurs as non-native species in Asia, Europe and South America. Despite the low population density usually found in its native range, M. leucophaeata forms dense clusters in newly invaded areas which lead to impacts on local organisms and environment. Some of the impacts of non-native species on newly colonized areas may be positive. However, despite the empirical evidences of increase in water transparency by freshwater dresseinids, the hypothesis that dark false mussel enhances the quality of brackish water has never been tested so far. Thus, the present study aimed to determine M. leucophaeata impacts on the water quality of a nutrient-enriched coastal lagoon by (1) analyzing a historical water dataset for pre- and post-invasion at Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon (Brazil) and (2) experimentally testing dark false mussel direct effects on water quality. Historical field data evidenced significant lower phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a, and higher water transparency for the post-invasion period. These pattens were also supported by time-series analyses, which detected a decreasing trend for total coliforms density and an increased trend for dissolved oxygen over time. Moreover, time series indicated a gradual increase in lagoon water level with time, but none or minor changes were evidenced for floodgates operation routine, meteorological variables, and the frequency of sewage input. In microcosms, M. leucophaeata was effective to increase water transparency and decrease E. coli densities. The combination of field and laboratory data partially supported the hypothesis that M. leucophaeata invasion promoted an improvement in lagoon water quality, but increased phosphorus availability through excretion in microcosm assays. Management of dark false mussel populations seems to be a potential strategy for water quality improvement within already invaded systems where high sewage-enriched effluents are released. However, as non-native species often unbalance ecological relationships and functioning of the invaded ecosystems, new introductions of M. leucophaeata must be avoided. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Glyphosate-based commercial formulations contain adjuvants, making them even more toxic than the active ingredient (a.i.) itself. The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is a freshwater invasive species which has been found to increase glyphosate dissipation in water and to accelerate eutrophication. The aim of this study is to evaluate the capability of L. fortunei to reduce the concentration of glyphosate in two commercial formulations, Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R). Results were compared with the decay of the a.i. alone and in presence of mussels. Evasive response and toxicity tests were performed in a first set of trials to analyze the response of L. fortunei exposed to Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R). Subsequently, we conducted a 21-day degradation experiment in 2.6-L microcosms applying the following treatments: 6 mg L-1 of technical-grade glyphosate (G), Glifosato Atanor (R) (A), Roundup Max (R) (R), 20 mussels in dechlorinated tap water (M), and the combination of mussels and herbicide either in the technical-grade (MG) or formulated form (MA and MR) (all by triplicate). Samples were collected at days 0, 1, 7, 14 and 21. No significant differences in glyphosate decay were found between treatments with mussels (MG: 2.03 +/- 0.40 mg L-1; MA: 1.60 +/- 0.32 mg L-1; MR: 1.81 +/- 0.21 mg L-1), between glyphosate as a.i. and the commercial formulations, and between the commercial formulations, suggesting that the adjuvants did not affect the degrading potential of L. fortunei. In addition to the acceleration of glyphosate dissipation in water, there was an increase in the concentration of dissolved nutrients in water (N-NH4+ and P-PO43-) even higher than that caused by the filtering activity of the mussels, probably resulting from stress or from the degradation of glyphosate and adjuvants. We believe that a larger bioavailability of these nutrients due to glyphosate metabolization mediated by mussels would accelerate eutrophication processes in natural water bodies. The approach used here, where L. fortunei was exposed to two commercial formulations actually used in agricultural practices, sheds light on the potential impact of glyphosate decay on water bodies invaded by this species.","2020-09-15","2021-08-11 16:16:46","2021-08-11 16:16:46","","",201,"","","","English","Place: 525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA Publisher: ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE Type: Article","Freshwater; Limnoperna fortunei; Degradation; Glifosato Atanor (R); Glyphosate; Roundup Max (R)",NA,"","wos_final"

To understand the effects of environmental and spatial variables, we performed Redundancy Analyses and variation partitioning to separate environmental and spatial pattern effects. Environmental variables explained almost twice the variation in the Pantanal mussel assemblages than did spatial variables. Unionida species presence was driven mainly by variations in sediment coarse sand and silt contents. The weak spatial patterns observed may be related to increased connectivity between lakes during floods, which facilitates mussel host fish dispersal.

In the aquatic environment, salinity is particularly recognized as one of the main abiotic factors that affects the physiology of organisms. Although the physiological patterns and challenges imposed by each occupied environment are distinct, they tend to converge to osmotic oscillations. From a comparative perspective, we aimed to characterize the osmoregulatory patterns of the bivalve mollusks Corbicula largillierti (purple Asian cockle), Erodona mactroides (lagoon cockle), and Amarilladesma mactroides (white clam) inhabitants of different osmotic niches - when submitted to hypo- and/or hyperosmotic salinity variations. We determined the hemolymph osmotic and ionic concentrations, tissue hydration, and the intracellular isosmotic regulation (IIR) from the use of osmolytes (organic and inorganic) after exposure to species-specific salinity intervals. Additionally, we incorporated phylogenetic perspectives to infer and even broaden the understanding about the patterns that comprise the osmoionic physiology of Bivalvia representatives. According to the variables analyzed in the hemolymph, the three species presented a pattern of osmoconformation. Furthermore, both ionic regulation and conformation patterns were observed in freshwater, estuarine, and marine species. The patterns verified experimentally show greater use of inorganic osmolytes compared to the participation of organic molecules, which varied according to the osmotic niche occupied in the IIR for the mantle, adductor muscle, and gills. This finding widens the classic vision about the preferential use of certain osmolytes by animals from distinct niches. Our phylogenetic perspective also indicates that environmental salinity drives physiological trait variations, including hemolymph osmolality and the ion composition of the extracellular fluid (sodium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium). We also highlight the important role played by the shared ancestry, which influences the interspecific variability of the hemolymph K+ in selected representatives of Bivalvia.","2020-02","2021-08-11 16:16:47","2021-08-11 16:16:47","","",240,"","","","English","Place: STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC Type: Article","Evolution; Invertebrate; Osmoconformation; Osmolytes; Salinity stress",NA,"","wos_final"

In this paper, we redescribe the shell, with new data on the soft parts and information on the distribution and conservation of D. granosus, a rarely recorded species. The shell is thin, not inflated; the macrosculpture is composed only by granules that cover the whole shell, not forming bars; the microsculpture comprises short spikes. In the soft parts we highlight the few, weak and irregularly distributed lamellar connections of the outer demibranch and some features of the stomach, such as the distally enlarged minor typhlosole. There are records of D. granosus over a large area of South America, from Guiana to Argentina. However, most of these records are related to other species and the distribution of D. granosus is restricted to the north of South America in the basins of the Amazonas and Orinoco rivers, and coastal rivers in between. Despite this wide distribution, the species occurs in specific habitats, mainly streams (igarapes), resulting in an extremely fragmented occurrence. Thus, any disturbance to these habitats can threat this freshwater mussel.","2020-03","2021-08-11 16:16:47","2021-08-11 16:16:47","44-53","1",50,"","","","English","Place: CAIXA POSTAL 478, ALAMEDA COSME FERREIRA, 1756, MANAUS, AMAZONAS 00000, BRAZIL Publisher: INST NACIONAL PESQUISAS AMAZONIA Type: Article","Unionida; conservation; Hyriidae; taxonomy; Rhipididontini",NA,"","wos_final"

DUI is a system in which distinct female-transmitted and male-transmitted mitotypes coexist in a single species. In families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae, the transition from dioecy to hermaphroditism and the loss of DUI appear to be linked, and this event seems to affect the integrity of the ORFan genes. These observations led to the hypothesis that the ORFans have a role in DUI and/or sex determination. Complete mitochondrial genome sequences are however scarce for most families of freshwater mussels, therefore hindering a clear localization of DUI in the various lineages and a comprehensive understanding of the influence of the ORFans on DUI and sexual systems. Therefore, we sequenced and characterized eleven new mitogenomes from poorly sampled freshwater mussel families to gather information on the evolution and variability of the ORFan genes and their protein products. Results: We obtained ten complete plus one almost complete mitogenome sequence from ten representative species (gonochoric and hermaphroditic) of families Margaritiferidae, Hyriidae, Mulleriidae, and Iridinidae. ORFan genes are present only in DUI species from Margaritiferidae and Hyriidae, while non-DUI species from Hyriidae, Iridinidae, and Mulleriidae lack them completely, independently of their sexual system. Comparisons among the proteins translated from the newly characterized ORFans and already known ones provide evidence of conserved structures, as well as family-specific features. Conclusions: The ORFan proteins show a comparable organization of secondary structures among different families of freshwater mussels, which supports a conserved physiological role, but also have distinctive family-specific features. Given this latter observation and the fact that the ORFans can be either highly mutated or completely absent in species that secondarily lost DUI depending on their respective family, we hypothesize that some aspects of the connection among ORFans, sexual systems, and DUI may differ in the various lineages of unionids.","2019-12-19","2021-08-11 16:16:47","2021-08-11 16:16:47","","1",19,"","","","English","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: BMC Type: Article","Freshwater mussels; Doubly uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial DNA; Evolution of protein structures and functions; Mitochondria and sexual systems; Mitochondrial ORFan genes; mtDNA sequencing",NA,"","wos_final"

Thus, the main aim of the current study is to evaluate the behavioural toxicity of cigarette butt leachates (CBL) in freshwater bivalve species Anodontites trapesialis exposed to different environmentally-relevant dilutions (CBL1x = 1.375%, CBL10x: 13.75%). There were significant CBL effects on the burrowing performance of the evaluated bivalves, after 14 exposure days. Animals exposed to CBL presented higher latency to foot emission and to start the burrowing process, as well as larger number of cycles required for burial. In addition, there were lower burrowing angle and burrowing rate index in CBL-exposed bivalves than in the unexposed ones. Chemical analyses performed on the muscle tissues of animals exposed to both CBL dilutions evidenced the bioaccumulation of several metals at high concentrations in CBL (Cr, Ni, Pb, Mn, Zn and Na); this outcome enabled associating these metals with behavioural changes observed in CBL-exposed groups. Thus, the current study firstly reports that even highly-diluted CBL concentrations can induce behavioural changes in freshwater bivalves, as well as that CBL extrapolation to natural environments can lead to several damages to the fitness of living organisms and to the dynamics of their population.

In recent decades, the introduction of contaminants into the environment has increased as a result of industrialization. The objective of this study was to verify the resistance of bivalve mollusks from freshwater native (Anodontites trapesialis) and exotic (Limnoperna fortunei) species to chemical contamination using an ex vivo/in vitro approach. Gill and muscle tissues were exposed to two different types of environmental stressors, copper (metal), and Roundup Transorb (R) (herbicide). The tissues were submitted to a cytotoxicity test in which the lysosomal integrity was assessed, from the adaptation of a method to isolated cells, and multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) test which evaluated cellular defense. In the exotic species, only copper at 9000 mu g/L and Roundup Transorb (R) at 5000 mu g/L were cytotoxic. In the native species, copper cytotoxicity at 900 and 9000 mu g/L and Roundup Transorb (R) at 50 and 5000 mu g/L were observed. Results were the same in both tissues. The MXR, responsible for the extrusion of contaminants (cell defense), was inhibited in both species when exposed to the contaminants, this cell defense system seems to be more inhibited in the native species, when exposed to both pollutants, indicating greater sensitivity. Therefore, cytotoxicity may be related to the lack of capacity of cellular defense. In relation to lysosomal integrity, the native species was more sensitive to cytotoxic pollutants, where a greater number of experimental conditions of metals and herbicide showed cytotoxicity, as well as more experimental situations inhibited its ability to defend itself.","2019-10","2021-08-11 16:16:47","2021-08-11 16:16:47","31198-31206","30",26,"","","","English","Place: TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY Publisher: SPRINGER HEIDELBERG Type: Article","Anodontites trapesialis; Limnoperna fortunei; Cytotoxicity; Ex vivo; MXR",NA,"","wos_final"

The isotopic signatures were reproducible between individuals of the same species. A. trapesialis clearly showed a strong delta O-18(S) cyclicity in accordance with its growth patterns while A. elongatus presented less clear delta O-18(S) with lower amplitude. We confirm that the deposition of successive growth lines and increments is annual, with growth line corresponding to the wet season. Also, we suggest that low amplitude of delta O-18(S) in the A. elongatus shells indicates a habitat close to the river while large amplitude of delta O-18(S) cycles observed in A. trapesialis shells would reflect a floodplain lake habitat, seasonally disconnected from the river and thus subjected to higher seasonal fluctuations in water delta O-18.

To investigate the cage fish farm as a vector for golden mussel invasion, we hypothesised that: (1) Limnoperna fortunei, a freshwater bivalve mollusc, finds greater food availability in the cage fish farm; (2) the cage fish farm favours mollusc colonisation and its nutritional status; and (3) its performance in the reservoir would vary over the year. We obtained data from limnological variables as well as the number of larvae and adult individuals, to evaluate condition index (CI) monthly from February 2015 to January of 2016. We established sampling stations at three points with fish farming and three points without fish farming (controls) in the Canoas II Reservoir, Paranapanema River, Brazil. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify spatial and temporal distribution of samples according to limnological variables. We performed a linear mixed model analysis to test the hypothesis of no difference between areas (fish farm and control) and time (months) for larval density and CI of L. fortunei. The first PCA axis (28.48% of variance) revealed a temporal gradient, showing the separation between cold and hot months. The second PCA axis (19.61% of variance) separated the samples of control and fish farms; fish farms displayed higher concentrations of total phosphorus, nitrite, and chlorophyll a. Larval densities of L. fortunei were higher in fish cage areas with time being responsible for 35% of this variation. Mussel CI was also higher in fish farms and time was responsible for 36% of the variation. We conclude that fish production in cages contributes to the establishment of golden mussels in the reservoir. Our results serve as a warning that other molluscs or invasive species may be favoured by aquaculture activities in aquatic environments.

In order to achieve this goal, Rapoport's rule, geometrics limits and co-ocurrence were evaluated. In addition, we analyze the source and sink hypotheses through the nested analysis. We observed a noticeable mid-domain effect (MDE), where a major richness than expected was randomly observed between 40 and 41 degrees S. The results revealed that the distribution pattern was not concordant with Rapoport's rule (r = 0.123; p = 0.128). Regarding to historical dynamic of the distribution, the results show a significant nestedness pattern, suggesting a source-sink dynamic, that is, poorer communities are a subset of richer communities in species. According to the co-occurrence analysis, an aggregate pattern existed, suggesting potential regulatory mechanisms. The specific richness pattern is explained by the variable seasonality of the temperature with a variance percentage explained of 35%. The full model indicated that variables which characterize the heterogeneity of habitat (i.e. range, Shannon), water availability (i.e., precipitation, density of water bodies) and topography (i.e., altitude area available) jointly explain 40% of the variability of the observed richness. This study shows that the geographical distribution of mollusc richness is mainly explained by mainly climatic and topographical environmental components, as well as by the source-sink dynamics.","2019-07-05","2021-08-11 16:16:48","2021-08-11 16:16:48","","",7,"","","","English","Place: 341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND Publisher: PEERJ INC Type: Article","Freshwater molluscs; Freshwater mollusks; Macroecology; Mid-domain null; Rapoport; Source-sink dynamic",NA,"","wos_final"

Using geometric morphometrics, shell shape was evaluated on the basis of both external (entire margin including alate processes) and internal (pallial line and positions of muscle scars and teeth) landmarks in Triplodon corrugatus, Paxyodon syrmatophorus and Prisodon obliquus. Samples of these species were collected from 2-5 sites on six rivers, which were classified as either small or large drainages, in the eastern Amazon region, Para state, northern Brazil. Interspecific comparisons in shell shape were also made among all three species where they co-occurred. Shell shape differed significantly among individuals of the same species from different sites and, in cross-validation tests, 94-96% of mussels were correctly classified into their river of origin according to their shape. For all three species, canonical variates analysis consistently differentiated between mussels from sites in large and small rivers, with the greatest difference in shell shape occurring between large and small rivers. Mussels from the large, clear or whitewater Tapajos, Amazon and Tocantins sites had a triangular shape with prominent posterodorsal and anterior winged processes, whereas those from the small, clearwater Trombetas, Irituia and Piria sites had a rounded shape, and lacked or had reduced dorsal winged processes. Where all three species co-occurred in the Tapajos and Trombetas sites, shell shape tended to converge. Paxyodon syrmatophorus from the Tapajos sites was most distinct, with very pronounced dorsal processes and a reduced shell disc.

Here we explored how this invasive clam responds to varying environmental pressures at the southernmost invasion front of its global distribution. We assessed population density, heavy metal content, body weight and shell growth of individuals collected from areas subjected to different farm drainage and runoff conditions in the Rio Negro estuary, Patagonia, Argentina. We found that clams from a habitat directly exposed to this source of pollution exhibited higher accumulation of copper, lower body weight, but higher individual growth than conspecifics from a downstream habitat less exposed to pollution, which followed the opposite trend. This asymmetric pattern supports the idea of resource-allocation strategies to varying environmental pressures occurring even over a small geographical range. Density showed no spatial differences, yet it was unusually low in spite of Corbicula having been established in the area for more than 15 years, which is consistent with a negligible population growth rate at the invasion front. This is the first study to report such an extended lag period for this successful worldwide invader. We discuss the implications of low densities for life-history traits that are selected for optimizing population growth at the invasion front.","2019-02","2021-08-11 16:16:48","2021-08-11 16:16:48","143-153","1",85,"","","","English","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","",NA,"","wos_final"

We studied 2 of these factors - an invasive mollusk (golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei) and the herbicide glyphosate - focusing on the effects of the mussel, the herbicide, and their interaction on the abundance and composition of different groups of biofilm bacteria present on the mussel's valves. We carried out semi-static experiments to assess changes in nutrient and glyphosate concentrations in the presence or absence of the mussel. The catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization technique was used to evaluate changes in biofilm bacteria growing on whole mussels or dissected valves. When the mussel was exposed to glyphosate, there was a significant decrease in the concentration of the herbicide, a significant increase in the concentration of its major metabolite (aminomethylphosphonic acid), and a significant increase in the concentration of nutrients. These results may be explained by the capacity of biofilm bacteria associated with L. fortunei to degrade glyphosate. After exposure to the herbicide, the analysis of 5 groups of Eubacteria (i.e. Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) showed a significant increase in the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting that they would participate in glyphosate transformation in water. This study represents a starting point for investigating the bacterial component of the biofilm present on the valves of L. fortunei. Moreover, this invasive mussel is a promising tool for glyphosate degradation. However, the liberation of nutrients as a consequence of the degradation of herbicide mediated by the presence of L. fortunei may accelerate eutrophication processes in freshwater ecosystems.","2019","2021-08-11 16:16:48","2021-08-11 16:16:48","83-94","1",83,"","","","English","Place: NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY Publisher: INTER-RESEARCH Type: Article","Limnoperna fortunei; Biofilm; CARD-FISH; Catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization; Gammaproteobacteria; Glyphosate degradation",NA,"","wos_final"

Bivalves were collected in the field and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 14 days. Then, a 14-day bioassay was carried out. Bivalves were exposed for 8 days to clean medium (control), microplastics (0.13 mg/L), mercury (30 mu g/L) and to a mixture (same concentrations) of both substances. The post-exposure recovery was investigated through 6 additional days in clean medium. After 8 and 14 days, the following endpoints were analysed: the post-exposure filtration rate (FR); the activity of cholinesterase enzymes (ChE), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), octopine dehydrogenase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferases (GST), and the levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO). After 8 days of exposure to mercury, the bioconcentration factors (BCF) were 55 in bivalves exposed to the metal alone and 25 in bivalves exposed to the mixture. Thus, microplastics reduced the bioconcentration of mercury by C. fluminea. Bivalves exposed to microplastics, mercury or to the mixture had significantly (p <= 0.05) decreased FR and increased LPO levels, indicating fitness reduction and lipid oxidative damage. In addition, bivalves exposed to microplastics alone had significant (p <= 0.05) reduction of adductor muscle ChE activity, indicating neurotoxicity. Moreover, bivalves exposed to mercury alone had significantly (p <= 0.05) inhibited IDH activity, suggesting alterations in cellular energy production. Antagonism between microplastics and mercury in FR, ChE activity, GST activity and LPO levels was found. Six days of post-exposure recovery in clean medium was not enough to totally reverse the toxic effects induced by the substances nor to eliminate completely the mercury from the bivalve's body.

In order to understand the isolated and mixed effects of these metals on these Neotropical bivalves, we run short-term experiments under laboratory controlled conditions. After 96 h-exposure, tissues (gills, mantle, digestive gland, muscle, hemolymph) were removed for metal bioaccumulation analysis, oxidative stress biomarkers (reactive oxygen species (ROS), total antioxidant capacity, lipoperoxidation (LPO), proteins carbonylation (PC), metallothionein (MT), activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase and hemocytes DNA damage) and cholinesterase (ChE versus ASCh activity) activity evaluation. We run three independent tests. In Zn test, clams were exposed to three concentrations of Zn (0.18 mg L-1, 1.0 mg L-1, 5.0 mg L-1); in Mn test, clams were exposed to three concentrations of Mn (0.1 mg L-1, 0.5 mg L-1, 5.0 mg L-1) and in Mix test, clams were exposed to the mixture Zn (1 mg L-1) + Mn (0.5 mg L-1), with and without Fe (5.0 mg L-1). After single exposure to 5.0 mg L-1, Zn bioaccumulated in all tissues, but only in mantle and hemolymph after exposure to 1.0 mg L-1. The increased MT in gills of A. trapesialis exposed to Zn appears to be sufficient to avoid damage, since LPO occurred only in digestive glands from animals exposed to 5.0 mg L-1. We suggested that A. trapesialis had a metabolic suppression in consequence of Mn presence, based on the following results: the decrease of ROS in gills, the decrease of the Zn and Mn concentrations in tissues and the decrease of ChE versus ASCh activity in muscle. Despite this, animals exposed to Mn suffer oxidative damages (LPO and PC) in the mantle and digestive gland and MT increased in the mantle. These results showed A. trapesialis responded differently to each metal and Mn caused more damage. When exposed to Fe, gills level of ROS was increased, despite no changes in metal accumulation occurred. On the other hand, after exposure to the mixtures, tissues bioaccumulated Zn and previously observed damages caused by Mn and Fe disappeared. Consequently, biomarkers were less affected under mixture treatments, demonstrating mixtures effects or responses were not simply a combination of single exposures to Zn, Mn and Fe, but depend on metals toxicokinetics.","2018-10-15","2021-08-11 16:16:48","2021-08-11 16:16:48","735-745","",161,"","","","English","Place: 525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA Publisher: ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE Type: Article","Essential metals; Metabolic suppression; Metal mixture; Metallothionein; Oxidative damage",NA,"","wos_final"

Clear differences were found between meander zones, with greater taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrates and greater freshwater mussel densities in the meander margin. A total of 12 families of macroinvertebrates were exclusive to the meander margin, and macroinvertebrate indicators of zones were Philopotamidae and Leptoceridae (meander margin) and Chironomidae and Elmidae (meander thalweg). In the meander margin, there were no differences in macroinvertebrate abundance, and taxonomic and functional group diversity among areas with low, medium and high mussel density. Macroinvertebrate abundance did not vary between zones, but in both, abundance was associated with lower pH and higher electrical conductivity. Low shear velocity, which stabilises the river bed, high organic matter content and percentage silt in the meander margin were associated with higher taxonomic and functional macroinvertebrate diversity, as well as the presence of freshwater mussels. Natural unaltered meanders are spatially heterogeneous in both habitat and biodiversity and, similar to restored meanders, support greater macroinvertebrate taxonomic and functional diversity, as well as maintain freshwater mussel beds, mainly by stabilising the river bed. The meander margin may also be important for attracting mussel host fish that feed on macroinvertebrates and aid mussel dispersal. Thus, the meander margins, and other similar riparian habitats with low shear velocity, for example, side channels and pools, have potentially high conservation value and should be afforded due protection.","2018-09","2021-08-11 16:16:48","2021-08-11 16:16:48","1118-1129","9",63,"","","","English","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","bivalve; functional groups; lotic habitat; organic matter; shear velocity",NA,"","wos_final"

Such live-dead approaches (LA/DA) can provide important baseline information on the ecological structure of ancient freshwater systems. This study explored variations in composition, richness, evenness and rank-abundance in live and dead mollusk assemblages recovered from the Ibicui River Basin, southern Brazil. LA/DA was related to topography, river size, and sediment grain size, separated respectively into plain (altitude 0-100 m) versus slope (100-500 m), small versus medium-large stream orders, and gravel versus sand substrate. Positive correlation between LA and DA species composition was significant only in large rivers. Slope areas showed LA/DA species compositions that were significantly different, whereas the communities from sand and gravel substrates were quite similar. Important factors that affected live/dead similarity in the study area included (1) destruction of thin, fragile shells of dead animals by acidic waters that are common in the region, (2) downstream drift of small spherical shells from species common in slope areas, such as Potamolithus sp., and (3) high abundances of invasive species in the local death assemblage, especially in large rivers. High fidelity in large rivers is caused by the presence of favorable habitats for bivalve communities. Coarse sediments are an important driver of macro invertebrate diversity, acting as shell traps that slow the downstream drift of bivalve remains and improve the preservation of fluvial mollusks. The preservation potential of dead assemblages of the Ibicui River showed that fossil assemblages are useful tools for recognizing ancient riverscapes, such as flat areas with sandy substrates.","2018-03","2021-08-11 16:16:49","2021-08-11 16:16:49","309-327","3",59,"","","","English","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","Bivalve; Gastropod; Paleoecology; Fluvial habitat; Quantitative fidelity; Spatial scale",NA,"","wos_final"

Ontogenetic allometry and shape variation in shells of D.chilensis from 2 different sites, Paimun lake and Chimehuin river, North Patagonia, Argentina, have been studied. For these purposes, geometric morphometric methods were used. Shell shape shows differences between sites, which the shells from Chimehuin river show less intrapopulation variability; are more elongated, with the anterior part extended upwards and the posterior part downwards; and show a steeper anterior curvature at the umbo compared to those from Paimun lake. These characteristics make shell shape more streamlined to withstand river current. Furthermore, the extended posterior-ventral part in river shells coincides with higher foot weight that would improve anchoring to the river rocky-sandy substrate. River shells present a bounded eco-morphotype whereas the higher variability of lake shells includes the river eco-morphotype. Growth is allometric throughout life in both sites and is not sex-dependent. The success of river repopulation programmes using mussels from lake populations may be increased by transplanting selected individuals that show river eco-morphotype.","2018-03","2021-08-11 16:16:49","2021-08-11 16:16:49","","2",11,"","","","English","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","river; Diplodon chilensis; geometric morphometric; lake; ontogeny; Patagonia",NA,"","wos_final"

Under laboratory conditions, we studied the combined effect of technical-grade glyphosate, Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R), in scenarios with and without L. fortunei, on phytoplankton from Salto Grande Reservoir (Uruguay River, Argentina). We expected that the effects of the interaction on phytoplankton and water quality would vary with the form of herbicide applied. The assay was conducted for 14 days (TO using 3-L bottles as experimental units. Eight treatments were performed in triplicate: C: Control; M: mussel; G: technical grade glyphosate acid; R: Roundup Max (R); Glifosato Atanor (R); MG: mussel + technical-grade glyphosate acid, MA: mussel + Glifosato Atanor (R) and MR: mussel + Roundup Max (R). The active ingredient was applied at 6 ppm. The dissipation of glyphosate in water was 1.5-2.6 times higher in presence of mussels. Treatments G and A showed an increase in phytoplankton abundance, mainly the cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. with rised to 289% and 639% at Tf, respectively, relative to their values at Ti. Roundup Max (R) limited the growth of Microcystis spp., as its abundance decreased 59% relative to Ti. L. fortunei reduced phytoplankton abundances at Tf. Evenness increased significantly in M, MG, MR and MA, while it decreased in G, R and A relative to C. The interaction of factors produced a significant synergistic increase in periphyton; periphytic chlorophyll a concentration was 0.81 +/- 0.02 mu g cm(-2) for MR; 0.09 +/- 0.02 mu g cm(-2) for MA and 0.02 +/- 0.01 mu g cm(-2) for MG.

These mussels may respond to multiple environmental stressors, such as temperature, through physiological mechanisms, behavioral responses, mortality or some combination of these. The aim of this study was to investigate the behavioral responses (valve closing), glycogen concentrations and mortality of L. fortunei under four different temperatures (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C) during a chronic test (30 days). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare glycogen concentrations across days of the experiment and at the different temperatures. Differences in valve-closing behavior and mortality among temperatures were tested using repeated-measures ANOVA. We observed that most of the mussels maintained at 5 degrees C closed their valves (74.7 +/- 15.3%), indicating that they remain inactive at low temperatures. The glycogen levels significantly differed among the temperatures tested. These differences occurred mainly due to the high glycogen values observed in mussels exposed to 10 degrees C. Stability in glycogen concentrations was observed within each particular temperature. The cumulative mortality was higher at extreme temperatures (5 degrees C and 30 degrees C). The ideal temperature for laboratory maintenance and tests is approximately 20 degrees C. Our data also show that L. fortunei can survive and maintain their energy reserves (glycogen) for several days at 5 degrees C, an important feature related to its invasion success.","2018","2021-08-11 16:16:49","2021-08-11 16:16:49","189-198","2",77,"","","","English","Place: MEDITGROUP, VIA G BELLI, 4, PAVIA, 27100, ITALY Publisher: PAGEPRESS PUBL Type: Article","Bioinvasion; golden mussel; physiology; valve closing",NA,"","wos_final"

In addition, glutathione-S-transferase and lipid peroxidation thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were analyzed in gill tissue. Mussels from an unpolluted site were treated for 3 d as follows: 1) experimental control; 2) solvent effects control (acetone 0.01%); 3) bacterial challenge effects control (E. coli, 5 cells/mL x 10(4) cells/mL); 4) pesticide effects control (AZM in acetone); 5) control for combined effects of solvent and bacterial challenge; and 6) exposed to AZM, then challenged with E. coli. The results showed increased granulocyte proportion and phagocytic activity. Partial reversion of deleterious effects of E. coli on lysosomal membranes was observed in mussels exposed to AZM and then challenged with E. coli. Total hemocyte number and humoral bacteriolytic activity were increased only by E. coli challenge. Acid phosphatase activity was increased by both E. coli and AZM, whereas the stimulating effect of E. coli on alkaline phosphatase activity was negatively modulated by AZM. Azinphos-methyl inhibited phenoloxidase activity regardless of the E. coli challenge. Gill glutathione-S-transferase activity was increased by E. coli treatment either alone or pretreated with acetone or AZM and by AZM alone. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels were reduced by AZM alone or combined with the E. coli challenge and by acetone followed by the E. coli challenge.

The latter had significantly lower carotene to chlorophyll a ratios and enzyme activities, and higher lipid peroxidation levels and chlorophyll a content than the former. These results show an adverse effect of glyphosate on the metabolism of periphyton community organisms, possibly inducing oxidative stress. On the contrary, no differences were observed in any of these variables between control and glyphosate-treated periphyton in the presence of L. fortunei.

Implications for biomanipulation in subtropical shallow lakes","MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH","","1323-1650","10.1071/MF15454",NA,"Zooplankton and bivalves are the main consumers of phytoplankton in shallow lakes; however, knowledge regarding trophic interactions between them is scarce. Competition for resources appears to be an obvious direct interaction, but the scheme may be more complex. Bivalves can consume all or only part of the zooplankton, constituting an intraguild predation module. In the present study we investigated the interaction between bivalves and zooplankton and its effects on phytoplankton grazing and community structure using an experimental approach in an aquarium. Two bivalve species were considered, namely Diplodon parallelopipedon (native) and Corbicula fluminea (non-native), in addition to a natural zooplankton community dominated by small-sized zooplankton. The findings indicate that phytoplankton consumption by the zooplankton is substantially less than that by the bivalves. Under the experimental conditions, the bivalves actively consumed small-sized zooplankton (rotifers and nauplii), but no consumption of medium-sized individuals (cladocerans and copepods) was observed. The differential consumption may have implications on the size and structure of zooplankton, favouring an average larger-sized community. Thus, phytoplankton may be negatively affected both directly by consumption and indirectly because of the resulting structure of the zooplankton community. The main results of the study are also discussed from the perspective of biomanipulation techniques in tropical and subtropical regions.","2017","2021-08-11 16:16:49","2021-08-11 16:16:49","1036-1043","6",68,"","","","English","Place: UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA Publisher: CSIRO PUBLISHING Type: Article","experimental conditions; filtration rate; grazing; trophic interactions",NA,"","wos_final"

Further, we compared these results with those induced by the combination of the mussel and technical-grade glyphosate. We carried out a 34-day experiment in outdoor mesocosms, applying the following six treatments: 6 mg L-1 of technical-grade glyphosate (G), the equivalent concentration of glyphosate in Roundup Max (R) (R), 100 mussels (M), the combination of mussels and herbicide either in the technical-grade or formulated form (MG and MR, respectively), and control (C). Herbicides significantly increased total phosphorus in water; R and MR showed greater initial total nitrogen and ammonium. R increased picoplankton abundance and caused an eightfold increase in phytoplankton, with high turbidity values; G had a lower effect on these variables. Herbicide-mussel combination induced an accelerated dissipation of glyphosate in water (MG 6.36 +/- 0.83 mg G g DW-1 day(-1) and MR 5.16 +/- 1.26 mg G g DW-1 day(-1)). A synergistic effect on ammonium was observed in MR but not in MG. MR and MG had an antagonistic effect on phytoplankton, which showed a drastic reduction due to grazing, as revealed by M. We provide evidence of differential effects of Roundup Max (R) and technical-grade glyphosate over water quality and microscopic communities, and in combination with mussels. However, in the combination of mussels and herbicides, mussels seem to play a leading role. In the presence of L. fortunei, the effects of higher nutrient availability provided by herbicides addition were counteracted by the filtration activity of mussels, which released nutrients, grazed on picoplankton and phytoplankton, and boosted the development of other primary producers, periphyton and metaphyton.","2016-09","2021-08-11 16:16:50","2021-08-11 16:16:50","18869-18882","18",23,"","","","English","Place: TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY Publisher: SPRINGER HEIDELBERG Type: Article","Invasive species; Limnoperna fortunei; Glyphosate; Roundup Max (R); Grazing rate; Microscopic communities; Multiple stressors; Outdoor mesocosms",NA,"","wos_final"

The mussels represent a target group for TiO2-NP toxicity, as they are filter feeders and are capable of bioaccumulating toxic compounds. Furthermore, the exotic organism Limnoperna fortunei, golden mussel, is a freshwater bivalve that has been used in biomonitoring environmental conditions. In this work, the TiO2-NP's ability to interact with haemocytes of golden mussel was assessed by transmission electron microscopy. The enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses were evaluated by superoxide dismutase (Sod) and catalase (Cat) activities and protein sulfhydryl content, which were measured after the golden mussel was exposed to TiO2-NP (1,5,10 and 50 mu g mL(-1)). Results demonstrate that TiO2-NP was internalized by cells, causing alterations in haemocytes membrane. Antioxidant activity of Sod and Cat decreased after 2 h TiO2-NP exposure. After 4 h exposure, the enzymatic antioxidant activity was restored. Notably, the protein sulfhydryl content decreased after 2 h to all the TiO2-NP concentrations and no alterations were observed after 4 h of TiO2-NP exposure.

Unfortunately, the knowledge of the aquatic diversity is poor in the high Andean systems (between 3 200 and 5 200 m.a.s.l. and rainfall below 300 mm per year), especially in the Argentinean peatbogs, a fact which has made difficult the interpretation of spatial patterns on a regional scale. The present study aimed to describe the composition of aquatic macroinvertebrates in seven peatbogs in the Argentinean Puna, and to analyze for the first time their spatial patterns. For this, we studied the relationship of these organisms with the environment, and obtained information about the surrounding vegetation and water physico-chemical characteristics. A total of 3 131 specimens of aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected, representing 25 taxa belonging to 22 families and 24 genera. In addition, 62 species of vascular plants were recorded, belonging to 20 families. The most abundant life form were the tufted grasses, followed by cushions. By using an NMDS (Non-Metrical Multidimensional Scaling) statistical analysis, the sampling sites were ordered in each peatbog as follows. The peatbogs located furthest West and South with higher water temperature were grouped on axis 1, whereas those with higher conductivity, whole water dissolved solids and salt concentration were grouped on axis 2. The water temperature was higher than air temperature at all times, and we found no association between temperature and altitude. The altitude had no correlation with the abundance of macroinvertebrates or with plant richness. Life forms such as scattered graminoids, trailing and prostrate herbs (in many cases they get into the channel) and aquatic plants were more abundant in peatbogs 4, 5 and 7 and they had a correlation with some macroinvertebrates belonging to functional trophic groups such as filter-collectors, collectors and scrapers. Finally, conductivity, whole dissolved solids and salt concentration had their highest value in peatbog 6, where Bivalvia (filter-collector) and Hyalella (collector) were also found. The results obtained attest that these macroinvertebrates displayed diversity and composition spatial patterns, the most important feature being their relationship with the surrounding vegetation, and to a lesser extent, with the physical and chemical traits of water in seven fertile lowlands in the Argentinean Puna.","2016-06","2021-08-11 16:16:50","2021-08-11 16:16:50","747-762","2",64,"","","","Spanish","Place: UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA Publisher: REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL Type: Article","vegetation; macroinvertebrates; aquatic ecosystems; neotropical; peatbogs; puna",NA,"","wos_final"

However, even though the larval stage may be considered an important species' characteristic, the invasion processes of L. fortunei are mainly evaluated using only the adult stage. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify what, and how, environmental filters might predict the likelihood of occurrence of each of the L. fortunei larval stages. Logistic regressions were applied using the larval stages of L. fortunei as a surrogate of population age structure and the environmental variables as the main filters that potentially predicted the likelihood of the occurrence of each larval stage of L. fortunei. The turbidity predicted the occurrence of the D-shaped larvae and straight-hinged veliger stages, while the umbonated-veliger and pediveliger stages were predicted by the pH and conductivity. Finally, the phytoplankton density (diatoms) predicted the occurrence of the umbonated-veliger, pediveliger and mainly the plantigrade stages. Our findings suggested that, during larvae development, from younger to older stages, the main environmental predictor of larvae occurrence shifted from abiotic to biotic variables, indicating that larval stages are indeed an important factor that helps in the evaluation of freshwater invasibility. These findings are particularly important for floodplain systems, where flood pulse dynamics may increase propagule pressure, leading to a successful spread among habitats. Then, even though environmental filters were important to predict successful invasions, we highlight that a successful invasion might depend on the population age structure of the invading species arriving in the new habitat. Thus, successful L. fortunei invasions in floodplain systems may depend on the interaction between invasiveness, invasibility and propagule pressure.","2016-05","2021-08-11 16:16:50","2021-08-11 16:16:50","1421-1430","5",18,"","","","English","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","Biological invasion; Golden mussel; Propagule pressure; Larval stages",NA,"","wos_final"

Microalgae are the main food source for captive mussels and unionids have displayed an ability to sort algae based on the cellular characteristics prior to ingestion. The main objective of the present work is to analyze the phytoplankton composition of the water from and of the gastrointestinal contents of the mussel D. enno, as an initial step for development of a suitable rearing diet. Therefore, water samples and bivalve specimens were collected from S. Francisco River, city of Paulo Afonso, Bahia, Brazil. The microalgal composition found in water and stomach/gut content samples was very diverse being represented by the following divisions: Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Dinophyta and Heterokontophyta (Diatoms). Concerning the relative abundance of microalgae divisions, it is possible to state, for the water and gastrointestinal contents, that Cyanophyta represents 15% and 14%, Chlorophyta 54% in both, Heterokontophyta 31% and 27% and Dinophyta 0% and 5%, respectively. According to the Brazilian CETESB criteria for phytoplankton species classification, 50% of Cyanophyta and 15% of Chlorophyta species observed in the water samples were classified as ‚Äúvery frequent‚Äù, as were 68% of Heterokontophyta and 33% of Chlorophyta species in the gut/stomach tract samples.

The present results showed that D. enno feeds not only on small chlorophytes microalgae, due to their convenient size that facilitates higher feeding rates, but also on large size diatoms, due to a possible nutritional advantage for the bivalves. Thus, a diet composed by large diatoms and small chlorophytes microalgae may be considered as the most reasonable for the maintenance of D. enno populations.","2016-06","2021-08-11 16:16:50","2021-08-11 16:16:50","352-359","2",76,"","","","English","Place: RUA BENTO CARLOS, 750 - CENTRO, SAO CARLOS, SP 00000, BRAZIL Publisher: INT INST ECOLOGY Type: Article","phytoplankton; Diplodon enno; gastrointestinal tract; Sao Francisco River",NA,"","wos_final"

Mussels were fed for 90 days with E. gracilis (EG) or Scenedesmus vacuolatus (SV, control diet), and then exposed for 10 days at three sites along the Pocahullo river basin: 1) an unpolluted site, upstream of the city (control, C); 2) upstream (UpS) and 3) downstream (DoS) from the main tertiary-treated sewage discharge, in the city of San Martin de los Andes, Northwest Patagonia, Argentina. Our results show that the total hemocyte number decreases while pollution load increases along the river course for both, EG and SV mussels. Phagocytic activity is higher in EG mussels than in SV ones under all conditions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in hemocytes increases with the increase in the pollution load, being significantly higher for EG mussels than for SV ones at DoS; no changes are observed for total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC). Hemocytes' viability is increased for E. gracilis diet at C and remains unchanged in this group of mussels when exposed at the polluted sites. Lysosomal membrane stability is higher in EG mussels than in SV ones for all conditions, although it is decreased at polluted sites compared with that at C. Antioxidant (catalase) and detoxifying (gluthatione S-transferase) defenses are generally lower in gills and digestive gland of EG mussels than in SV ones. Lipid peroxidation (TBARS) is evident in gills of EG mussels at C, and in digestive gland of the same group, at all the sites. Gill mass factor (GF) is affected by the E. gracilis diet; it is increased at C and decreased at polluted sites when compared with that of SV ones. Digestive gland mass factor (DGF) is higher in EG mussels than in SV ones. In D. chilensis, continuous and long term feeding with E. gracilis cells favors immune response and reduces the damage caused by sewage pollution exposure on hemocytes. Nevertheless, diet and transplantation procedures may produce negative effects on the oxidative balance of gills and digestive gland and should be taken into account for bioremediation strategies.

This approach, however, relies on a thorough understanding of how manganese is incorporated into the shell material - a point that remained controversial so far. Here we clarify this issue, using state-of-the-art X-ray absorption and X-ray emission spectroscopy in combination with band structure calculations. We verify that in the shells of all studied species manganese is incorporated as high-spin Mn2+, i.e. manganese always has the same valence as calcium. More importantly, the unique chemical sensitivity of valence-to-core X-ray emission enables us to show that manganese is always coordinated by a CO3-octahedron. This, firstly, provides firm experimental evidence for manganese being primarily located in the inorganic carbonate. Secondly, it indicates that the structure of the aragonitic host is locally altered such that manganese attains an octahedral, calcitic coordination. This modification at the atomic level enables the bivalve to accommodate many orders of magnitude more manganese in its aragonitic shell than found in any non-biogenic aragonite. This outstanding feature is most likely facilitated through the non-classical crystallization pathway of bivalve shells.","2016-03-09","2021-08-11 16:16:50","2021-08-11 16:16:50","","",6,"","","","English","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","",NA,"","wos_final"

We explored the joint impact of glyphosate and the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei on freshwater phytoplankton, bacterioplankton and periphyton, and on the physical and chemical properties of the water. We manipulated both stressors simultaneously in a 25-day experiment using outdoor mesocosms; we assayed technical-grade glyphosate acid at four concentrations: 0, 1, 3 and 6 mg gly L-1 under scenarios with and without mussels. The addition of the glyphosate significantly increased total phosphorus according to the concentration used; the high clearance rate of L. fortunei significantly decreased phytoplanktonic abundance leading to low values of turbidity. The mussel significantly stimulated the development of filamentous green algae (metaphyton). Interestingly, the combined effect revealed that L. fortunei accelerated the dissipation of glyphosate, which showed a 4-fold decrease in its half-life; this promoted the rapid bioavailability of glyphosate-derived phosphorus in the water. The interaction had a synergistic effect on soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations and was directly dependent on the concentration of glyphosate. A synergistic effect was also observed on bacterioplankton, water turbidity and metaphyton, thus inducing enhanced and rapid eutrophication. The ability of mussels to reduce glyphosate in water may be valued as positive, but our results allow us to predict that the invasion of Limnoperna fortunei in natural freshwater systems contaminated by glyphosate will accelerate the negative impact of the herbicide associated with eutrophication.","2016-01","2021-08-11 16:16:50","2021-08-11 16:16:50","56-68","1",25,"","","","English","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","Limnoperna fortunei; Glyphosate; Anthropogenic stressors; Synergism; Outdoor mesocosms; Eutrophication",NA,"","wos_final"

The timing of these age-related changes is coincident with the age estimated (28 years) from the lower confidence interval for L-infinity (the asymptotic length, 69.97 mm), at which the bivalves would reach their minimum growth rate. D. chilensis qualifies as an environmental mitigator for water and sediment clearance. Individuals near the age of minimum growth (20-30 years) would be better suited for bioremediation strategies compared with younger individuals (more sensitive) or to older ones, which are less active and show increasing lipid peroxidation with age.

Several biomarkers of exposure were significantly altered in the tissues of caged fathead minnows and freshwater mussels relative to the upstream reference sites. Biomarkers altered in fish included induction of CYP3A metabolism, an increase in vitellogenin (Vtg) gene expression in male minnows, elevated ratios of oxidized to total glutathione (i.e. GSSG/TGSH), and an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (i.e. glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase). In mussels, there were no significant changes in biomarkers of oxidative stress and the levels of Vtg-like proteins were reduced, not elevated, indicating a generalized stress response. Immune function was altered in mussels, as indicated by elevated lysosomal activity per hemocyte in P. grandis caged closest to the wastewater discharge. This immune response may be due to exposure to bacterial pathogens in the wastewater. Multivariate analysis indicated a response to the CECs Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Trimethoprim (TPM). Overall, these data indicate that there is a 1 km zone of impact for aquatic organisms downstream of WWTP discharge.

Gill and digestive gland protein contents, along with digestive gland bacteriolytic activity were higher in EG than in SV mussels. Both SV and EG mussels showed increased gill mass upon E. coli challenge, while digestive gland mass was increased by bacterial challenge only in SV mussels. Bacterial challenge produced no effect on humoral reactive oxygen species levels of both groups. Total oxyradical scavenging capacity levels was reduced in challenged SV mussels but remained unaffected in EG ones.

The ability of mussels to voluntarily detach and reattach elsewhere has important implications for biofouling control.","2015","2021-08-11 16:16:51","2021-08-11 16:16:51","599-611","7",31,"","","","English","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","Limnoperna fortunei; golden mussel; attachment-detachment; byssus; macrofouling; mobility",NA,"","wos_final"

P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) is a defence mechanism analogous to multidrug resistance (MDR), which has been demonstrated in several aquatic organisms. This system protects cells against the entry and the accumulation of xenobiotics and has been proposed as a biomarker for pollution assessment. We conducted a study in a post-urban reach of Esquel stream (Chubut Province) downstream a wastewater treatment plant, in order to assess the presence and activity of MXR in five freshwater macroinvertebrate species (Helobdella michaelseni, Helobdella simplex, Patagoniobdella variabilis, Hyalella curvispina and Chironomus riparius). We measured the accumulation of the model P-gp substrate rhodamine B (RB) in organisms previously exposed to pollution. Our results described the activity of the MXR system in the three species of leeches suggesting their suitability as the in vivo biomonitoring. We also identified a dependence of the transporter activity with the development stage in H. simplex, highlighting the importance of using organisms of similar size classes since it may affect observed results. Finally, we concluded that benthic freshwater macroinvertebrates possess different species-specific levels of MXR activity possibly influencing their natural distribution as well as their survival.","2014-11","2021-08-11 16:16:51","2021-08-11 16:16:51","","11",225,"","","","English","Place: GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND Publisher: SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG Type: Article","Macroinvertebrates; MXR; Chironomidae; Hirudinea; Hyalellidae; P-glycoprotein; WWTP",NA,"","wos_final"

Animals were exposed to 2 and 10 ppb of ATZ (ATZ2 and ATZ10), 2 and 10 ppm of RD (RD2 and RD10) and the following mixtures: 2 ppb ATZ+2 ppm RD (AR2) and 10 ppb ATZ + 10 ppm RD (AR10). Activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as the multixenobiotic resistance mechanism (MXR), reduced glutathione concentrations (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were measured in gills and digestive gland. DNA damage was determined in clams hemocytes through the comet assay. The gills were more susceptible to the action of the herbicides and the results showed that ATZ2 and ATZ10 caused a significant reduction in EROD and the mixture leads to a significant decrease in EROD and MXR. No significant change in the biotransformation parameters was observed in the digestive gland. Regarding the primary antioxidant defenses, SOD activity increased in the gills of clams exposed to ATZ10 and RD10 and in the digestive gland of animals exposed to RD2 and RD10, CAT activity was significantly reduced only in digestive gland of clams exposed RD10 while GPX increased in the gills after exposure to ATZ2 and RD10. The exposure to RD10 caused a significant increase in LPO in both gills and digestive gland. While the exposure to ATZ and RD separately did not increase DNA damage, the exposure to AR2 and ARID caused a significant increase in the occurrence of DNA damage. In conclusion, this study showed that both herbicides applied alone caused effects on C. fluminea; ATZ interfered mostly in biotransformation while RD interfered mainly in antioxidant defenses leading to lipid peroxidation. The herbicides mixture showed antagonistic effects on the gills EROD and on lipid peroxidation in gills and digestive gland and synergistic effects on the gills MXR and on DNA damage in the hemocytes.

In Nonthue (chemical and biological oxygen demand ratio COD/BOD ratio of 4.7), a dense neighboring forest provides higher quantities of vegetal detritus compared to Yuco, while in SMA the OM input increase is related to anthropogenic impact, mainly sewage discharges, which is more biodegradable (COD/BOO ratio of 1.7). Our results show that population's size distribution and growth rates are affected positively by increased OM, independently of its natural or anthropogenic origin. The modal shell length interval for SMA and Nonthue is twofold higher (70 mm), in agreement to the growth rate increase (k = 0.079), compared to Yuco (35 mm, k = 0.045). The morphometric relationships between size-size and size-mass show a higher slope for SMA and Nonthue, which underline allometric differences between these two populations and the Yuco's one. The lower population densities in both sites (SMA 33 ind./m(2) and Nonthue 76 ind./m(2)) compare to Yuco (176 ind./m(2)) and the absence of individuals younger than 7 and 5 years old, respectively, in SMA and Nonthue could be related to the higher allochthonous OM content in the sediments and total suspended solids in water. Increased OM due to urban pollution in SMA bivalves leads to higher oxidative damage to lipids, which is not counterbalanced by the higher detoxification enzyme glutathione-S-transferase activity. Hence, we can conclude that pollution would explain the drastic reduction in population density, probably related to a high impair in the juvenile's survival/recruitment, the higher observed mortality and the lower population longevity. When increased OM is supply by the forest, like in Nonthue, this has less negative effect on population density and no effect on longevity at all. However, a negative effect of oxygen depletion due to increased OM (either anthropogenic or natural) on juvenile survival cannot be discarded, but further studies should be carried out to support this idea.

Toxic cyanobacterial blooms and biological invasions are major threats to freshwater systems worldwide. While usually dealt with independently, the two threats can interact to produce synergistic or antagonistic outcomes. The aim of this survey is to analyse interactions between the cyanobacterium Microcystis spp. and the Asian invasive mussel Limnoperna fortunei. 2. On the basis of 9 years of observational data in a large subtropical reservoir (Salto Grande, Argentina-Uruguay), we analyse causal relationships between recurring summer-early autumn blooms of Microcystis spp. and recruitment by L.fortunei. Reproduction of the mussel was interrupted during dry summers (January-April), coinciding with periods of peak Microcystis spp. growth and low water discharge (which favours build-up of algal biomass). On the other hand, wet summers with high discharge rates were characterised by low Microcystis spp. densities and high numbers of L.fortunei larvae in the water column. 3. Of the seven South American waterbodies investigated, Salto Grande was the only one with very marked cyanobacterial blooms and where larval numbers decrease to near zero during January-April; in all others, reproduction peaks in January-April. 4. The assumption that microcystin-producing algae are responsible for these troughs during periods when elsewhere larvae are very abundant was reinforced by experimental results indicating that microcystin-LR is highly toxic to the mussel's larvae, eliminating 58-100% of animals in 48h at 10-20 mu L-1. 5. Paradoxically, high concentrations of microcystin in water are probably partly due to L.fortunei's own activity, which enhances growth of Microcystis spp. through modification of nutrient concentrations, selective grazing of solitary Microcystis spp. cells over colonial ones and production of chemical cues that trigger the formation of colonies. 6. These interactions have important implications for the management of biofouling of industrial raw cooling water facilities by the byssate mussels, as well as policies oriented at curtailing the spread of the invasive bivalve.","2013-09","2021-08-11 16:16:52","2021-08-11 16:16:52","1968-1981","9",58,"","","","English","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","Limnoperna fortunei; microcystin; Microcystis spp.; reservoirs; toxic algal blooms",NA,"","wos_final"

Punta Indio exhibited lower abundances of recruits (<1 mm) and post-recruits along with a larger adult size than those at Bagliardi Beach. The extent of air exposure appeared to be a major constraint regulating mussel densities in these areas. The high recruitment at Bagliardi Beach indicated continuous reproduction that was positively correlated with temperature changes. Recruits survived in low water temperatures (10.7 degrees C). The species' abundance had stabilized by several years after the invasion. In contrast, at Punta Indio, settlement availability depended on critical environmental conditions. The multivariate analysis-identified a combination of physicochemical variables, of temperature, dissolved solids, and oxygen saturation, that best explained the golden mussel's abundance. Possible north-to-south larval dispersal may have influenced recruitment patterns. The von Bertalanffy growth model suggested that populations consisted of three principal cohorts at both Bagliardi Beach and Punta Indio: Lt = 18 to 20 mm (first-year growth) and L-inf = 30 mm. Mussels of Punta Indio showed faster growth rates (k) than those at Bagliardi Beach, probably because of wave exposure and low population densities. Conclusions: This work provides specific information that complements our present knowledge of the ecology of this invasive mollusk. Further studies will be essential to gain an understanding of the population dynamics and the way in which the golden mussel reacts to stressful conditions.","2013-07","2021-08-11 16:16:52","2021-08-11 16:16:52","","",52,"","","","English","Place: 128 ACADEMIA RODA, SECTION 2, NANKANG, TAIPEI, 11529, TAIWAN Publisher: BIODIVERSITY RESEARCH CENTER, ACAD SINICA Type: Article","Biological invasion; South America; Brackish water; Hard substrate; Population dynamics",NA,"","wos_final"

We tested mussel mortality in 30-day exposures to constant and fluctuating salinities at different temperatures in the laboratory. Test conditions simulated different seasons of the year and locations with increasing influence of marine waters in Rio de la Plata, Argentina. Significant mortality (31 % after 30 days) was observed at a constant salinity of 2 aEuro degrees, increasing to 45 and 57 % at 5 and 10 aEuro degrees, respectively. In contrast, considerably greater tolerances were observed when conditions in the experimental chamber fluctuated between salt water and fresh water. No significant mortality was observed in mussels exposed to a salinity cycle with abrupt salinity changes ranging 1-23 aEuro degrees (mean 2.68 aEuro degrees) over a month. Tolerance to this type of regime was unaffected by different temperatures within ambient ranges. Tests at constant salinity underestimate the tolerance of this and probably other freshwater nonindigenous species (NIS) to short-term saltwater exposures. Estuarine ports account for ca. 2/3 of non-marine ports globally, thus constituting donor and recipient hotspots for the spread of NIS propagules into continental aquatic ecosystems via shipping vectors. The tolerance of L. fortunei to estuarine conditions likely contributes to the species' remarkable invasive success. These results highlight the need to determine causes of invasiveness and to study NIS traits not alone but in combination with transport network properties.","2013-06","2021-08-11 16:16:52","2021-08-11 16:16:52","1355-1366","6",15,"","","","English","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","Limnoperna fortunei; Estuaries; Invasiveness; Ports; Propagule transport; Salinity tolerance",NA,"","wos_final"

In this work the art of pearl culture is presented as a skill to be acquired from practice and training, which is accessible to any producer that accomplished continuity in the farming procedures. The historical development of pearl culture, from the ancient Buddha Pearls to pearls in vitro, has happened in linear events through improvements of manual and mechanical means. The wide diffusion of pearl farms relies on episodes of environmental history throughout special coincidences in the regions.

Most of the biological and ecological studies of L. fortune!, having been restricted to specific locations, lack comparative analyses among different habitats. In this investigation, we examined the differences in larval density, density in settlement plates, shell allometry, and growth between two populations from the Rio de la Plata basin, Argentina. One of the populations inhabited a heavily polluted area, whereas the other a moderately polluted area. We predicted that the density and growth of the golden mussel would be lower in the heavily polluted environment, expecting therefore to find variations in shell allometry as a consequence of differences in density and environmental conditions between the sites investigated. We accordingly found that the larval density, the density of settled individuals, and the growth were lower in the more polluted environment. We also observed allometric differences because the individuals from the moderately polluted area with higher population densities were more elongated (i.e., with a higher shell length-to-width ratio). The golden mussel tolerates a wide range of environmental conditions and can survive in many polluted water bodies where other invasive species cannot. The findings presented here support the idea that L. fortunei can inhabit heavily polluted environments, but at the expense of a significant decrease in its biologic potential.","2013","2021-08-11 16:16:52","2021-08-11 16:16:52","43-58","1-2",56,"","","","English","Place: 2415 SOUTH CIRCLE DR, ANN ARBOR, MI 48103 USA Publisher: INST MALACOL Type: Article","freshwater mussel; invasive species; population dynamics; water pollution; growth rate",NA,"","wos_final"

The aim of the paper was analyze the size selective predation by the freshwater crab Zilchiopsis collastinensis Pretzmann, 1968 on different sizes of the invasive bivalve L. fortunei. We considered three combinations (AC. AD and BD) of equal numbers of three different shell lengths of mussels: A (small) = 7 to 10.99 mm. B (medium) = 11 to 14.99 mm and C = 15 to 18.99 mm and D = 19 to 22.99 mm (large). These combinations were offered to each adult female intermolt crab individually, and the number of mussels remaining was registered after one, two and 24 hours to evaluate prey-size selection. After this trial, ten female crabs were recorded preying on two different sizes of mussels (A and C) in combination (AC), and we registered the selective feeding behavior (feeding methods and time of predation) with each size of mussel. The results indicated that female crabs ate different sizes of golden mussels, showing an increased consumption of large mollusks after 24 hours, although these sizes demanded higher predation times. Large mussels were encountered at the first time (one and two hours) by the crabs, and these mussels were consumed successfully in the combination AD. These female crabs showed several alternative strategies to access the flesh and were efficient in handling large mussels, presenting an advantageous degree of plasticity for their predatory responses.

Microbial communities are altered when glyphosate reaches water bodies. The freshwater golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is an invasive species that has rapidly dispersed since it was introduced in Argentina two decades ago. Mussels alter aquatic conditions through their filtrating activity by increasing water clarity and nutrient recycling. We aim to evaluate the potential capacity of the golden mussel to reduce glyphosate concentration in water, in laboratory conditions. Firstly, the evasive response of mussels to glyphosate (10, 20, and 40 mg l(-1)) was evaluated and a toxicity test was carried out for these concentrations. A three-week experiment was then performed to assess glyphosate variation under mussel presence for two mussel sizes. Finally, mussels' role on glyphosate concentration was evaluated considering different mussel parts (living organisms and empty shells) through another three-week experiment. Laboratory experiments were performed in triplicate using 2-l microcosms. An initial glyphosate concentration between 16 and 19 mg l(-1) was used, and when mussels or valvae were added, 20 organisms per aquaria were used. Samples were obtained at days 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, and 21. Glyphosate decreased by 40% under large mussel presence in both experiments, and was reduced by 25% in empty shell treatments. We believe that part of the herbicide that disappears from the water column is adsorbed in valvae surface, while another proportion is being mineralized by microbial communities in shells' biofilm. The mechanisms by which living mussels increase glyphosate dissipation would be degradation, possibly mediated by bacteria associated to mussel's metabolism. Glyphosate half-life depended on mussel and valvae presence and varied with mussel size. L fortunei presence (either alive or as empty valvae) alters glyphosate concentration in water. We provide preliminary observations from laboratory experiments, with strong potential ecological consequences, about two stressors that could be acting jointly on the environment.

One of the main pesticides used in the species occurrence region is the atrazine herbicide, which has a great contamination potential in the aquatic environment. Therefore, several studies into its toxicity in aquatic systems have been developed. However, the tested concentrations are usually very high and rarely found in the environment and the short-term exposure responses in other aquatic organisms such as native bivalves are still scarce. Thus, this study sought to consider the potential effects of environmentally realistic concentrations of atrazine herbicide on the surface morphology of gill filaments of the bivalve D. expansus under laboratory-controlled conditions after short-term exposure. None of the animals died before the end of the experiment. The main alterations were observed on the frontal surface of filaments, which include mucus accumulation, cilia loss, and disruption. Mucus increased secretion and accumulation in the frontal filaments region preceded as a protective mechanism. Cilia loss and disruption on the frontal surface of the gill filament indicated that ciliated frontal cells were more sensitive to atrazine exposure and these alterations may cause gills functional damages, compromising the uptake of food particles and respiration. Therefore, higher sublethal concentrations of atrazine may compromise the survival and consequently the population of D. expansus in agriculture areas after a longer period of continuous exposure.

Specimens of the bivalve Corbicula fluminea were exposed to nominal concentrations of Pb 5 mg l(-1) for 96 h. Isolated gill cells were exposed to three concentrations (1, 10, and 100 mu M) for 5 h. Metal toxicity was evaluated by cell viability (trypan blue exclusion). We also analyzed Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and carbonic anhydrase activity. Additionally, the multixenobiotic-resistance (MXR) phenotype was evaluated by the accumulation of rhodamine B (RB). Immunolabeling was used to quantify the expression of P-glycoproteins (C219) and proteins involved in ion transport, water movement, and cellular repair using antibodies against Na+/K+ ATPase, aquaporin 1, and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Pb was shown to be toxic in both in vivo and in vitro tests, in which cellular viability significantly decreased by approximately 25%. Cellular viability in the in vivo assays was determined by gill cell isolation after the entire animal was exposed to Pb. We observed that Na+/K+ ATPase activity was inhibited by 70%. Also, the expression of the MXR phenotype significantly increased in our in vivo tests. A statistically significant difference was observed in the expression of all proteins in the in vitro assays, whereas only Hsp70 increased in vivo. Employing these analyses, we could validate the sensitivity of the in vitro tests and can propose our in vitro model as a possible tool for environmental assessment.","2012-01","2021-08-11 16:16:53","2021-08-11 16:16:53","56-67","1",62,"","","","English","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","",NA,"","wos_final"

It spread upstream in the La Plata basin reaching the Paraguay River in the vicinity of the Pantanal wetland, Brazil, around 1998. The role of abiotic factors in controlling establishment and abundance of this species is not well known, making projections of its risk of further spread difficult. This study evaluates the importance of abiotic factors to L. fortunei populations established in rivers of the Pantanal, focusing on larval and juvenile densities and taking advantage of a wide range of seasonal variability in water temperature, flow, dissolved oxygen, and suspended material. Temperature, river stage (influencing several water characteristics) and water velocity are the main variables related to the larval and juvenile densities. In the Pantanal, environmental variables vary over a broader range compared with other South American locations, subjecting L. fortunei to oxygen depletion, low calcium, low pH, and high water velocity and suspended solids, associated with low chlorophyll a concentrations. The combined effect of several of these conditions may explain the relatively low densities in some Pantanal sites. However, they probably will not prevent the persistence of populations in the Pantanal and the eventual establishment of viable populations in upriver systems connected to the Pantanal. These results are pertinent not only to this species but also to other aquatic invasive invertebrates whose expansion may be limited by thermal extremes, episodic oxygen depletion, and waters that are too dilute or acidic for optimal biocalcification.","2011-03","2021-08-11 16:16:53","2021-08-11 16:16:53","717-729","3",13,"","","","English","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","Freshwater mollusks; South America; Wetlands; Aquatic invasive species; Calcium; Oxygen",NA,"","wos_final"

These values were intended to serve as a baseline for detecting anthropogenic impacts on Patagonian marine fjord ecosystems in later studies. Benthic macroalgae and invertebrate suspension feeders were primarily considered, with some supplementary data from cyanobacteria, plankton, fish, and coastal vertebrates. Six depth transects typified the lateral salinity gradients from the innermost part of the fjord to its mouth, as well as the vertical density gradients caused by freshwater inflow. Carbon isotope signatures indicated predominant consumption of either CO2 or HCO3- for benthic macroalgal. All CO2 users belonged to rhodophytes. The delta N-15 values of benthic macrophytes decreased with decreasing salinity, both vertically and along the fjord axis. This implies the influence of N-15-poor terrestrial dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) at these sites. Enhanced influence of freshwater influx also lowered N contents and increased C/N ratios in algal tissues. Exceptionally high macroalgae delta N-15 values at the seabird and sealion colony Isla Liliguapi point to animal faeces as an additional source of N-15-enriched DIN. Thus, DIN sources not originating from the open sea are additionally utilised by the benthic macroalgae in the fjord.

Data on L. fortunei were obtained in Rio Tercero Reservoir, Argentina, whereas studies on D. polymorpha were conducted in North America and Europe. We found that, similar to the zebra mussel, L. fortunei creates high densities on hard substrates in the littoral zone, and avoids soft substrates in the profundal zone; however, the overall population density of L. fortunei in a water body seems to be higher than that of zebra mussels. Additional studies on Limnoperna are needed to confirm this hypothesis. The effect of L. fortunei on macrobenthos is very similar to the effect of D. polymorpha and is associated with an increase in the overall diversity, density, and biomass of native macroinvertebrates in druses compared with bare sediments. The presence of L. fortunei druses in the littoral zones of Rio Tercero has increased the average species richness of native benthic invertebrates per sample by almost 70% and their density and biomass by threefold, positively affecting epifaunal organisms and negatively burrowing invertebrates and unionids. In the near future, the freshwaters of North America may be colonized by L. fortunei, resulting in strong impacts on entire invaded ecosystems and devastating impacts on native unionids, especially in the southern regions of the United States, which are not colonized with dreissenids.","2010-12","2021-08-11 16:16:54","2021-08-11 16:16:54","975-984","4",29,"","","","English","Place: C/O DR.

To assess the effects of this dietary shift on the growth of P. lineatus, 28-day laboratory experiments were carried out feeding newly hatched P. lineatus larvae with three diets: zooplankton artificially enriched with L. fortunei veligers; natural zooplankton; and zooplankton artificially enriched with cladocerans and copepods. The average length, weight and gut contents of the fish larvae were assessed weekly and metabolic rates of fish larvae were measured. 3. Proportions of veligers in gut contents were always higher than those in the experimental diet: 100, 76 and 21% for veliger-enriched, natural and low-veliger diets, respectively. Larvae fed a veliger-enriched diet grew to a significantly larger size than larvae fed the other two diets. In energetic balance comparisons using metabolic rates and prey energy content, all three diets were sufficient to support metabolism and growth. The greatest values of excess energy at the end of each week were in the veliger-enriched experiments. 4. Feeding on veligers of L. fortunei significantly enhances the growth of P. lineatus larvae and supports the idea that this new and abundant resource is selectively preyed upon by P. lineatus during its larval stage.

In order to test this hypothesis, a comprehensive study was conducted in 30 sites regularly distributed across the region. At each site, the abundance of mollusk species was determined, and a series of physico-chemical measurements taken. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) were used for the ordination of sampling sites based on the measured environmental variables. In addition, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was conducted to explore the relationships between environmental variables and mollusk abundances. Mollusk species were represented by the gastropods Biomphalaria peregrina, Chilina parchappii, Heleobia parchappii, Physa acuta, Pomacea canaliculata, Stenophysa marmorata, Uncancylus concentricus and the bivalve Musculium argentinum. Although aquatic vegetation cover, conductivity, and substrate were among the main parameters influencing mollusk distribution, their effect was insufficient to explain the spatial distribution pattern of the species in a regional scale. It is because the Southern Pampas is a very homogeneous area, and the ranges of these environmental conditions are within the range of ecological tolerance of most of the species represented. Yet, some species resulted good indicators of environmental conditions at local (microhabitat) scale, i.e., particular microhabitats that occur in different water bodies as well. In fact, even distributed in many different water bodies along the Southern Pampas C. parchappii is always linked to lotic environments, and U. concentricus is exclusively restricted to hard substrata. On the other hand, H. parchappii is the only species represented in mesohaline waters and P. acuta appeared to be a good indicator of pollution in the area.","2010-03","2021-08-11 16:16:54","2021-08-11 16:16:54","133-143","1",641,"","","","English","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","Freshwater mollusks; Argentina; Buenos Aires",NA,"","wos_final"

This created a wetland, which was colonised by the waterweed Egeria densa and, subsequently, by large populations of the black-necked swan, which fed on the weed. Reported catastrophic declines in the weed and swan populations in 2004 coincided with the opening of a large cellulose plant upstream, leading to popular and scientific condemnation of the plant. In 2008, samples of the freshwater bivalve Diplodon chilensis were retrieved from the bed of the Rio Cruces at several locations downstream of the plant, and the growth patterns of the bivalves were studied in thin section. Trace element profiles of bivalves were determined by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP/MS). Some of the bivalves had ages of almost 50 yr, indicating that they colonised the drowned riverbed less than a decade after the earthquake. There were no growth recessions or abnormalities in the shells corresponding to 2004, the year the plant opened. Patterns of trace elements in the shells describe aspects of the evolution of the watershed, track annual cycles in rainfall and indicate patterns of soil erosion and/or sediment input. Sr, Ba and Mn have strong annual cyclicity; Ba and Mn are viewed as indicators of soil erosion. Peaks in Ba were large immediately after the earthquake, whereas Ba peaks in the last few decades were of much smaller amplitude. The changes in Ba patterns probably indicate changes in patterns of soil erosion: high erosion rates immediately after the earthquake, slowing as the basin fills. Cu appears as annual low-level peaks in abundance in about 1975, which continue to the present. This may be the result of spraying of fungicides in the watershed, which is heavily used by agriculture. Similarly, scattered peaks in As around 1980 may indicate the use of pesticides.

The present survey overcomes these shortcomings and addresses the question whether Limnoperna's impact on the ecosystem-wide scale is measurable and significant. On the basis of diver-collected bottom samples, we estimated the overall density of this mussel in a reservoir (Embalse de Rio Tercero, Argentina), where Limnoperna is present since 1998 and analyzed changes in several water-column properties before and after the invasion. The 47 km(2) reservoir hosts around 45 billion mussels; at these densities, a volume equivalent to that of this water body can potentially be filtered by the bivalves every 2-3 days. Data collected regularly since 1996 indicate that after the invasion water transparency increased, and suspended matter, chlorophyll a, and primary production decreased significantly, with strong changes occurring in the area with highest mussel densities. Our results indicate that the ecosystem-wide impacts of Limnoperna are generally comparable to those described in Europe and North America for another invasive mussel-Dreissena polymorpha. However, given Limnoperna's wider tolerance limits, its influence on newly invaded water bodies, potentially including Europe and North America, will probably be stronger.","2009-12","2021-08-11 16:16:54","2021-08-11 16:16:54","271-284","1",636,"","","","English","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","Limnoperna fortunei; South America; Invasive bivalves; Ecological impact; Population density",NA,"","wos_final"

Osmotic and ionic changes in its watery environment represent a challenge for the tissues of this mollusk. Thus we evaluated, in vitro, muscle tissue volume variations (based on wet weight change) under anisosmotic salines, as well the possible regulatory mechanisms involved in the processes. This tissue did not exhibit complete volume regulation under anisosmotic saline solutions, but showed less variation than would be predicted by Van't Hoff's law, and tissue volume remained essentially stable throughout 90 min of exposure. To minimize tissue swelling in hyposmotic situations, C fluminea muscle mobilizes organic osmolytes (ninhydrin positive substances) and inorganic ions (K+ and Cl-). While under hyperosmotic stimulus, apparently only inorganic osmolytes (Na+ and Cl-) are mobilized by the tissue. Our results indicate ionic accumulation by the Na+-K+-2Cl(-) cotransporter and the Na+/H+ coupled to Cl-/HCO3- exchangers. Exposure of the muscle tissue to Ca2+-free anisosmotic saline did not result in a detectable inhibition of the mechanisms described above. The Ca2+ gradient that derives from the absence of this ion, even apparently enhances the regulatory mechanisms. These responses of this freshwater mollusk in hyperosmotic solutions, and the muscle tissue under anisosmotic (hypo and hyperosmotic) saline solutions, have not been previously characterized in the manner and approach as reported here. Specifically, we analyze both organic and inorganic osmolytes mobilized under hyposmotic stress, and can infer the participation of Na+ and Cl- pathways stimulated by hyperosmotic stress. From the perspective gained in this study, tissue volume responses may be used as models for toxicological investigations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This system is one of the most important estuarine environments in the continent, being a highly productive area that sustains valuable artisanal and coastal fisheries in Uruguay and Argentina. The main goals of this paper are to summarize recent knowledge on this estuary, integrating physical, chemical and biological studies, and to explore the sources and ecological meaning of estuarine variability associated to the stratification/mixing alternateness in the estuary. We summarized unpublished data and information from several bibliographic sources. From study cases representing different stratification conditions, we draw a holistic view of physical patterns and ecological Processes of the stratification/mixing alternateness. This estuary is characterized by strong vertical salinity stratification most of the time (the salt-wedge condition). The head of the estuary is characterized by a well-developed turbidity front. High turbidity constrains their photosynthesis. Immediately offshore the turbidity front, water becomes less turbid and phytoplankton peaks. As a consequence, trophic web in the estuary could be based on two sources of organic matter: phytoplankton and plant detritus. Dense plankton aggregations occur below the halocline and at the tip of the salt wedge. The mysid Neomysis americana, a key prey for juvenile fishes, occurs all along the turbidity front. A similar spatial pattern is shown by one of the most abundant benthic species, the clam Mactra isabelleana. These species could be taken advantage of the particulate organic matter and/or phytoplankton concentrated near the front. Nekton is represented by a rich fish community, with several fishes breeding inside the estuary. The most important species in terms of biomass is Micropogonias furnieri, the main target for the coastal fisheries of Argentina and Uruguay. Two processes have been identified as producing partially stratified conditions: persistent moderate winds (synoptic scale), or low freshwater runoff (interannual scale). Less frequently, total mixing of the salt wedge occurs after several hours of strong winds. The co-dominance of diatoms (which proliferate in highly turbulent environments) and red tides dinoflagellates and other bloom taxa (better adapted to stratified conditions), would indicate great variability in the turbulence strength, probably manifested as pulses. Microplankton and ichthyoplankton assemblages defined for the stratified condition are still recognized during the partially mixed condition, but in this case they occupy the entire water column: vertical structure of the plankton featuring the stratified condition become lost. Bottom fish assemblages, on the contrary, shows persistence under the different stratification conditions, though the dominant species of the groups show some variations, Summarizing, the Rio de la Plata Estuary is a highly variable environment, Strongly stratified most of the time but that can be mixed in some few hours by strong wind events that occur in an unpredictable manner, generating stratification/partially mixed (less frequently totally mixed) pulses all along the year. At larger temporal scales, the system is under the effects of river discharge variations associated to the ENSO cycle, but their ecological consequences are not fully studied. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Until today, 166 species have been described, 101 belonging to 10 families of Gastropoda and 65 to 7 of Bivalvia. Families with highest specific richness are Lithoglyphidae (22) and Sphaeriidae (25), respectively. The number of endemic species (those present only in Argentina) by family is: Gastropoda: Ampullariidae (1), Cochliopidae (10), Lithoglyphidae (11), Thiariidae (3), Chilinidae (11), Lymnaeidae (2) and Physidae (2?); Bivalvia: Hyriidae (1?); Etheriidae (1?) and Sphaeriidae (10). Families with a distribution that comprise almost the whole country are: the Sphaeriidae and the gastropods Cochliopidae, Chilinidae and Lymnaeidae. Families Erodonidae and Solecurtidae (Bivalvia) were registered in mixohaline environments from Buenos Aires province.

A total of 266 individuals were collected; 8 pulmonates, Mayabina spiculata, Mexinauta impluviatus, Physa sp., Biomphalaria havanensis, Drepanotrema lucidum, Drepanotrema kermatoides, Planorbella (Pierosoma) trivolvis, and Planorbula armigera; 2 prosobranchs, Pyrgophorus sp. and Pomacea flagellata; and one bivalve, Musculium transversum. Pulmonata dominate over Prosobranchia species in diversity. No significant differences were observed in diversity between dry and rainy seasons. However, species abundance recorded in both seasons was very low, probably due to a combination of inadequate food resources and disadvantageous climate (periodic conditions of drought and flooding). Further studies using a combination of different sampling methods and more frequent samplings are needed to confirm or identify these factors. We suggest that future studies should focus on cultivation of species with economic potential such as the apple snail Pomacea flagellata.","2007-12","2021-08-11 16:16:55","2021-08-11 16:16:55","303-310","2",78,"","","","English","Place: APARTADO POSTAL 70-233, MEXICO, D F 00000, MEXICO Publisher: INST BIOLOGIA, UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO Type: Article","diversity; bivalves; Yucatan Peninsula; abundance; freshwater snails",NA,"","wos_final"

The survey was based on comparisons of L. fortunei-covered and L. fortunei-barren areas in five artificial cages from where large predators were excluded, exposed to colonization by the mussel for a total of 17 months in the lower Parana river delta. Accompanying invertebrates were dominated by Oligochaeta, Nematoda, Rotifera, Copepoda, Gastropoda, Hirudinea, Chironomidae and nauplii. Also present in minor numbers were Tardigrada, Turbellaria, Cladocera, Ostracoda, Insecta, Hydracarina and Decapoda. Dominant invertebrates were 27-100% more numerous (and hosted 43-100% more biomass) in areas with L. fortunei than in areas barren of the mussel. In areas with L. fortunei, total invertebrate biomass (excluding the bivalve) was positively correlated with mussel biomass, and increased with time of exposure under water. No such trend was observed in areas barren of L. fortunei. It is suggested that higher invertebrate growth is associated with enhanced substrate complexity and, probably, the transfer of organic matter from the plankton to the sediments due to the mussels' feces and pseudofeces. Some of the adverse ecosystem-wide effects of filter-feeding invasive mussels observed in European and North American water bodies may be offset in the Parana by the extremely high loads of organic matter in these turbid waters.","2007-09","2021-08-11 16:16:55","2021-08-11 16:16:55","15-27","",589,"","","","English","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","freshwater; Limnoperna fortunei; invasive species; bivalves; ecological impact; benthic invertebrates",NA,"","wos_final"

Cages with 15 and 40 mm screens lost between 1 and 2 kg x m(-2) x year(-1). Aquatic mammals, birds, and especially fish, are probably the main consumers of large mussels. Small L. fortunei are most probably eaten by fish and also by several invertebrates, including crustaceans, leeches and gastropods. It is suggested that L. fortunei intercepts a significant fraction of the organic carbon that the Parana-Uruguay rivers flush into the ocean, locally boosting numbers of benthophagous animals, deposit feeders and, indirectly, higher level predators. Our results indicate that only 15 years after its first introduction in South America this invasive species is very actively consumed by local predators, but predatory suppression of the mussel seems very unlikely. Comparisons with the effects reported for the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in Europe and North America suggest that L. fortunei is consumed more actively and that its negative impact on the local fauna is more restricted. These differences are attributed to the fact that while D. polymorpha feeds chiefly on plankton, a limited resource, L. fortunei feeds on detrital particulate organic matter, whose supply in these large South American rivers largely exceeds consumption.","2007-06","2021-08-11 16:16:55","2021-08-11 16:16:55","403-415","4",32,"","","","English","Place: 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: BLACKWELL PUBLISHING Type: Article","Limnoperna fortunei; invasive species; predation; trophic impact; trophic webs",NA,"","wos_final"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic contamination of the Guaiba Lake Hydrographic Region, through the determination of damage by the micronuclei and comet assays in L. fortunei (golden mussel). Nine sampling sites were evaluated in three different seasons: five sites in the mouths of the main rivers that flow into Guaiba lake; one site at the mouth of a stream; one major site of sewage discharge; two sites at Guaiba lake, near a sewage discharge; and the control site in a preservation area. DNA damage was detected by the single cell gel assay, as well as the frequency of micronuclei in hemocytes of mussels exposed under laboratory conditions for 7 days to water and sediment samples. Significant results were found in different seasons in almost all sampling sites (P < 0.05, ANOVA Dunnet's test). Most of the positive results were found in samples affected mainly by urban effluents. It was possible to observe that there was a weak relation between mutagenic and genotoxic responses and mussels inorganic elements contents. Seasonal variation was observed at different sampling sites, but always indicating a huge contamination near urban sewage discharge. These results are consistent with previous studies, allowing us to infer that urban contamination is the biggest problem in this region.

Both species are sessile, byssate bivalves with a planktonic larval stage and extremely high reproductive capacity. For both species adults attain much higher biomass in waterbodies they invade than all of the Dative invertebrates combined, and they create substrate complexity otherwise not found in freshwater systems. Both are very active suspension feeders, greatly enhance benthicpelagic coupling, and act as effective ecosystem engineers. Although taxonomically unrelated, their ecosystem impacts are surprisingly similar and follow from the novel ecological niche they share, rather than being species specific. The golden mussel has broader environmental tolerances and therefore may be a much more successful invader than D. polymorpha in regions dominated by acidic, soft and contaminated waters. In the near future L. fortunei may colonize the southern and central parts of North America, much farther north than has been previously predicted.

We suggest that the spread of these exotic species has not been a continuous process, but rather punctuated by periods of rapid long distance spread (jump), during which species greatly expanded their geographic ranges. Each jump has been associated with changes in the tempo of some human activity, such as the construction of shipping canals for trade, building of reservoirs for water storage and power production, political boundary changes or changes in political systems, which affected the position or permeability of national borders, human migration, changes in the mode and volume of international trade, or recent industrial practices and environmental laws. We hypothesize that the rate of spread of exotic species depends on the spatial scale of spread and may be accelerated or slowed by various human activities. In general, aquatic exotic species may quickly spread along connected waterways in a new continent they invade and soon reach their maximum range (continental scale). However, it will take much longer to colonize all isolated regions (regional scale) and longer still to spread to all isolated lakes and river systems (local scale).

This area is recognized as an important ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù of benthic freshwater biodiversity in Southern South America. In Chilean temperate lakes, increased nutrient loads of P and N caused eutrophication, particularly in the Nahuelbutan Lakes. The freshwater Hyriidae mussel Diplodon chilensis (Gray, 1828) which is one of the most abundant species in Chilean temperate lakes, is known to be very susceptible to eutrophication. This species presents a clear reduction in its geographic ranges and is considered to be a threatened species in many Chilean lakes. In this study, we used a correlative approach to determine how eutrophication-driven changes in the food supply and in geographical parameters of different Chilean lakes affected the shell growth rates of D. chilensis. The results obtained from sclerochronological analyses of the mussel shells suggest an association with a group of environmental variables, including geographical types (negative), such as latitude and altitude, and limnological types (positive), especially phosphorous and turbidity. However, the D. chilensis populations under extreme conditions of turbidity in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes are extinct or nearly so. The high positive correlation of the mean D. chilensis growth rates with orthophosphate (R = 0.76; P < 0.05), in relation to dissolved inorganic nitrogen, suggests that P is the major limiting factor of the primary productivity in Chilean temperate lakes. We discuss some implications of our results in terms of the conservation of biodiversity in temperate lake ecosystems at different taxonomic levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

The mollusks were exposed to 0.6, 1.2 or 2.4 X 10(-4) M MMS for 40 min and their hemolymph, gill tissue and digestive gland tissue assessed for the level of DNA damage and the time needed for the tissues to recovery. Regression analysis showed a direct linear dose-response relationship between MMS concentration and the number of damaged cells for hemolymph and digestive gland tissue but a quadratic relationship for gill tissue, which made the interpretation the gill tissue results difficult. The basal level of DNA damage to gill tissue was very high, possibly because gill is the organs most directly exposed to environmental toxins and mutagenic agents.

Two additional nit and nuclear ribosomal lineages were detected in a minority of New World populations; all three produced biflagellate sperm, a morphological marker for clonality in this clam taxon. Two of 12 New World samples exhibited qualitatively distinct nuclear/organellar genetic disjunctions. One of these (Iguazu Falls) appears to have resulted from hybridization, but the other (Rio Grande Form A) appears inconsistent with hybridization, and we propose that it may have resulted from in situ androgenetic clonal capture.

Given the rising trend in worldwide shipping traffic, a future North American invasion by the pest mussel organism is probable. Because of L. fortunei's economic threat, adequate control measures must be developed. This investigation examined L. fortunei's susceptibility to chlorine and three nonoxidizing molluscicides proven to be effective in controlling the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpba. In general terms, two of the molluscicides were either ineffective or marginally effective at the concentrations recommended for the zebra mussel, especially at lower temperatures. The third molluscicide was the most toxic of the compounds tested; concentrations of greater than or equal to1 mg/L yielded >50% mortalities at all temperatures. At 15 and 20degreesC, chlorine at 5 mg/L resulted in total kills after three to six weeks of exposure. At 25degreesC, it was effective at all concentrations (1-100 mg/L), achieving 100% mortalities in 11-17 days. Temperature substantially enhanced the toxicity of all the chemicals tested, particularly chlorine. The authors concluded that the commercial formulations widely used to control the North American invading pest D. polymorpba are ineffective for L. fortunei. Furthermore, in contrast to Dreissena, which spawns over a two- to three-month period, Limnoperna has a long period of active reproduction, a fact that will further complicate its control. These findings indicate that direct extrapolation from the ample experience gained in dealing with the zebra mussel will be of limited value in meeting the challenge of L. fortunei.-MPM.","2003-01","2021-08-11 16:16:57","2021-08-11 16:16:57","66+","1",95,"","","","English","Place: 6666 W QUINCY AVE, DENVER, CO 80235 USA Publisher: AMER WATER WORKS ASSOC Type: Article","",NA,"","wos_final"

Many chemicals sorb to sediments and, subsequently, are released in the digestive tract of animals. The assessment of sediment-bound chemicals has been difficult because of the complexity of the association between these chemicals and natural particles. To simplify this complexity, we previously devised a test system using artificial particles with known chemical structures. In the present work, we improved this experimental design by adding humic materials as a source of organic matter. Bioassays were conducted by exposing the fingernail clam Sphaerium corneum to sublethal levels of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in the presence or absence of the artificial particles, treated with or without a commercial preparation of humic acids. The results showed that the bioavailability and bioaccumulation could be explained on the basis of the interactions of PCP with the active groups and/or the backbone of the resins, both in systems with or without humic acids. This model may constitute a useful approach to modeling and predicting the uptake and accumulation of chemicals bound to natural sediments.","2001-12","2021-08-11 16:16:57","2021-08-11 16:16:57","2910-2915","12",20,"","","","English","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","artificial particles; Sphaerium corneum; bioaccumulation; pentachlorophenol bioavailability; sediment-bound chemicals",NA,"","wos_final"

In order to evaluate the possibility of mitigating salmon farming impacts through the management of benthic communities, we measured the ability of D. chilensis to filter algae and clear the water column of particulates and dissolved nutrients associated with salmon farms. A 3 month experiment growing juvenile salmon with and without mussels was conducted in outdoor tanks where dissolved nutrients and chlorophyll a were measured before, during and after addition of mussels. In addition, the filtering ability of mussels was measured in laboratory aquaria under different algal concentrations ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic. Within 18 days, D. chilensis reduced chlorophyll a concentrations in tanks with fish by two orders of magnitude (from similar to 300 to 3 mu g l(-1)) compared to tanks without it. Concentrations of total phosphorous, PO4 and NH4 were also reduced by about one order of magnitude after 18 days, through to day 39 from the beginning of the experiment. Thus, mussels were able to change a hypereutrophic situation resulting from salmon culture re an oligotrophic one. Since the tanks were closed systems, the effect of mussels declined by day 61, probably due to the excessive accumulation of organic matter. In the aquarium experiments, D. chilensis showed a maximum cell retention rate (60 x 10(6) cells ind(-1) h(-1)) at chlorophyll concentrations between 20 and 30 mu g l(-1). Considering their high filtering rate (ca. 1.31 h(-1) ind(-1)) and high density in Chilean lakes, particularly in coastal areas and bays (50 to 200 ind m(-2)), mussels may exert a considerable filtering effect on lakes. In addition, mussels may play an important role in reducing nutrient loadings. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Among them, several free spermatid morulae, spermatids, and spermatozoa were observed. Each free spermatid morula is surrounded by an external membrane. The early spermatids enclosed within the morulae have dense and homogeneous chromatin, and the cytoplasm occupies little space around the nucleus. Later, during spermiogenesis, the SC show lysis and disrupt to liberate the spermatid morulae. The membrane of the free morula is then disrupted, releasing the young spermatids. The SC disappear just after the appearance in the testis of a large number of free young spermatids. The nucleus of each free spermatid becomes gradually smaller and denser by the appearance of a granular pattern of condensed chromatin. During the maturation phase of the spermatids, the cytoplasm becomes more voluminous, and mitochondria and centrioles are more evident. Then, flagellogenesis occurs, and the nucleus gradually condenses into thicker strands. In the mature sperm, the apical zone has a disc-shaped acrosomal vesicle and the midpiece contains five mitochondria and two centrioles located at the same level. The flagellum has the common 9 + 2 microtubular pattern.

The gonad produces a small number of large, yolky eggs and few sperm simultaneously. Eggs are incubated within both inner demibranchs, and embryos (45 to 90) are retained until released as fully developed juveniles. At the light microscope level, the oosorption process implies: 1) breakage of the egg cell membrane and consequent liberation of vitellinic material to the alveolar lumen, 2) phagocytosis of the vitellinic droplets by the follicule cells, and 3) reaction of blood amoebocytes that invade the acinus lumen to phagocytose the remnants of the degenerated oocytes. Oosorption is frequently found in gonads which have recently spawned; however, it has been also detected in unspawned ones. Phagocytosis by the follicule cells affects oocytes in a late stage of vitellogenesis as well as ripe and unspawned ova. Although in other mollusks (mainly in gastropods), the follicule cells are involved in the phagocytosis of degenerative oocytes, the process is not as extensive as reported here in E. platensis. Assuming that parent energy devoted to reproduction is a finite and limited resource, and taking into account the reduced number of large ova susceptible to being retained within inner demibranchs, the oocyte breakdown and subsequent phagocytosis of degenerated oocytes by follicule cells are here considered as processes which, integrated with the set of life history traits that constitutes the reproductive strategy of the species, leads to prevention of important energy loss that would imply the development of surplus gametes with no chance of success.","1997-01-02","2021-08-11 16:16:58","2021-08-11 16:16:58","47-54","1",40,"","","","English","Place: SANTA BARBARA MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, 2559 PUESTA DEL SOL RD, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93105 Publisher: CALIF MALACOZOOLOGICAL SOC INC Type: Article","",NA,"","wos_final"

Relative abundances of algal species were generally similar in the medium and in the stomachs of clams, suggesting the absence of feeding selectivity on the basis of taxonomic group or size-class, Diatoms made up a slightly but consistently larger (yet not significantly different) proportion of the diet of C. fluminea than of the plankton; this pattern is attributed to enhanced preservation of algal siliceous frustules, rather than to feeding selectivity. It is suggested that non-selective feeding by the bivalve is a response to the overall scarcity of food and, probably, to food collection by a combination of deposit and filter feeding.","1995-09-22","2021-08-11 16:16:58","2021-08-11 16:16:58","171-182","3",312,"","","","English","Place: SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL Type: Article","freshwater; phytoplankton; grazing selectivity; molluscs",NA,"","wos_final"

The mussels were sampled through transects using quadrats of 1 m-2. The individuals were manually collected with SCUBA and free diving. Data on substrate type, percentual of plant cover and depth were also recorded. A total of 443 m-2 were sampled in the lake. Four species of Unionacea (Diplodon charruanus, Anodontites trapesialis, Anodontites (cf.) patagonicus, Monocondylaea minuana) and two of Corbiculacea (Neocorbicula limosa and Corbicula fluminea) are registered. D. charruanus was the most abundant species, occurring in the over-all substrates with the greatest mean density (ind. m-2) in the muddy sand subset of the lake. The lowest mean density of this species is on the pure mud subset. M. minuana was restricted to a band of 1.0 - 1.5 m of depth, sandy substrate. There are indicatives of a crash in the population of A. trapesialis. Only five individuals of A. (cf.) patagonicus were registered. N. limosa and C. fluminea apparently are restricted to a sand shore near and into the outlet channel, though the population of the exotic C. fluminea seem is on the rise.","1994-12","2021-08-11 16:16:58","2021-08-11 16:16:58","233-250","4",29,"","","","English","Place: P O BOX 825, 2160 SZ LISSE, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SWETS ZEITLINGER PUBLISHERS Type: Article","",NA,"","wos_final"

All the species studied show a locomotory cortex and a thigmotactic cortex. The locomotory cortex consists of kineties with monokinetids except Myxophthirus which most often shows paired and ciliated kinetosomes. Myxophyllum presents a thin microfibrillar rope long the right side of kinetosomes whereas Myxophthirus has 2-3 longitudinal microtubules parallel to each kinetie as in Thigmotrichs (Proboveria). Ribbon of sub-kinetial microtubules are clearly seen in the cortex in Conchophtirus. The monokinetids of the cortical locomotory kineties have the Scuticociliate-fibrillar tangential derivates, notably the transverse tract with the ribbon of transverse microtubules. The thigmotactic cortex always consists of dikinetids. The posterior kinetosome of the latter supports the fibrillary tangential systems similar to those associated with isolated kinetosomes. The anterior kinetosome shows some transverse microtubules and a transverse tract. The two kinetosomes of each dikinetid in Myxophyllum, Myxophthirus and Conchopthirus species are displaced and each kinetosome is associated to parasomal sac. In Proboveria the kinetosomes of each cluster are in a straight line and the middle kinetosome bears a kinetodesmal fibre similarly to the posterior kinetosome. A thigmoplasm formed by vesicles and saccules is always differentiated in the thigmotactic zone. The location of the anterior suture line of kineties which delimits both principal faces is always reinforced by a cytoskeleton consisting of microtubules into a matrix. Both Myxophyllum and Myxophthirus endoplasm show numerous thick mitochondria whereas the chondrioma of either Conchopthirus or that of the Thigmotrichs (Ancistrum, Proboveria and Boveria) consists chiefly of long and big chondrioconts included in the ectoplasmic crests. Overall, the paroral organelle is a stichodyade associated with a microfibrillar network. Myxophyllum and Myxophthirus species have a single adoral organelle formed by several rows of kinetosomes. Among those, some support postciliary microtubular fibres. The three adoral organelles of the buccal cavity-upper limit of Conchopthirus differ from those observed within the Thigmotrichs. In this group indeed, the adoral organelles develop through a juxtaposition of 2-3 rows of kinetosomes-bearing postciliary microtubules. Lastly, it seems suitable to join together both Myxophyllum, Myxophthirus from one hand and Thigmophrya species from the other hand within the Thigmophryidae group which is ranged in the Scuticociliated Philasterina. In addition, we propose that the Conchopthiridae should be distinguished into the Scuticociliates Pleuronematina. Since we lack ultrastructural data on the whole Pleuronema-Histiobalantium group, a new sub-order Thigmotrichina should thus be accepted.","1992","2021-08-11 16:16:58","2021-08-11 16:16:58","221-231","4",31,"","","","French","Place: UL PASTEURA 3, 02-093 WARSAW, POLAND Publisher: NENCKI INST EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY Type: Article","CILIATES; CORTEX; ULTRASTRUCTURE",NA,"","wos_final"

In Brazil the species occurs in the center-south region, corresponding to the upper Parania River. These medium-sized mollusks live buried in muddy substrata, are slightly heteromyarian, and are dioecious, with sexual dimorphism evident in the shell conformation. The siphons are simple (type AII of Yonge, 1957), and mantle fusion occurs only through the inner fold. The incurrent siphon has tentacles originating from the inner fold and the excurrent siphon exhibits a few tubercles, probably of sensory function. The ctenidia are of type D (Atkins, 1937). Internally, females posses a well-developed marsupium in the inner demibranch in which eggs are incubated. The stomach is a type IV structure (of Purchon, 1958), and is quite uniform when compared to that encountered in other freshwater bivalve families.","1991-01-02","2021-08-11 16:16:58","2021-08-11 16:16:58","21-31","1",34,"","","","English","Place: SANTA BARBARA MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, 2559 PUESTA DEL SOL RD, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93105 Publisher: CALIF MALACOZOOLOGICAL SOC INC Type: Article","",NA,"","wos_final"
